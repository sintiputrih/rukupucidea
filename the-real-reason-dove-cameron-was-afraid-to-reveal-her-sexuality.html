The actor-singer, who has been in Disney projects for <a href=#>nearly ten years</a>, told the publication, "I felt like I wouldn't be accepted." Cameron's moment of truth came when creating the lyric video for her July 2020 single "We Belong." "It had moving line drawings of people falling in love," she described the visual imagery, adding, "It was all a man and a woman making out and it was a weird moment for me."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>After telling producers to add a kissing gay and a lesbian couple, Cameron revealed she then faced allegations of "queerbaiting."&nbsp;As she told Gay Times, "Everybody got the idea that the song was a big LGBTQ+ anthem song," the "Descendants" star said.&nbsp;"I went on [August 2020's] Instagram Live and said 'Guys, I really needed to explain something to you. Maybe I haven't said it, but I'm super queer. This is something I want to represent through my music because it's who I am.'"</p><p dir=ltr>Cameron avoids labeling her sexuality. "[Coming out] was about who I am as a whole rather than who I choose to date or sleep with," she stated, adding&nbsp;she did not want to "edit myself depending on the room that I'm in." Wisely said!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWpjbYZ5e9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl2ZvLexjJyYpp2ipLtuw8CsZJqeopa2pXnTqGSrnaaarq15x56pZquVrcKiuMitsGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
