In September, a separate source told Us that the Grammy winner even <a href=#>lent Turner her apartment</a> while she was <a href=#>staying in NYC</a> to deal with <a href=#>custody arrangements</a>. (Us confirmed in September that Jonas, 34, <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> from Turner after four years of marriage.

At the game against the Los Angeles Chargers last month, Brittany and Swift showed off <a href=#>their celebration handshake</a> after the Chiefs scored a touchdown.</p><p>“Brittany is thrilled to be <a href=#>building a genuine friendship</a> with Taylor. They’ve hung out a couple of times and have grown fairly close in a short period of time,” a second insider told Us in October. “Brittany thinks Taylor is so sweet, and down to earth, and they get along really great.”</p><p>Turner and Brittany first connected in September as Swift invited them and pal <a href=#><strong>Blake Lively</strong></a> out <a href=#>to dinner in New York City</a> ahead of the <a href=#>Chiefs vs. New York Jets game</a>.
