The <b>clues</b> that <b>foreshadow danger</b> is the “blood red waters of the Caribbean” that swallowed <b>Rainsford</b>, him hearing gunshots, the blood found in a crushed bush, and Ivan’s reaction to finding him at the door.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-an-example-of-a-flashback-in-the-most-dangerous-game></span>What is an example of a flashback in The Most Dangerous Game?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Game</b> 1. <b>Flashback: In The Most Dangerous Game</b>, when General Zarroff was telling Rainsford about his past life, is and <b>example</b> of <b>flashback</b>. “Here I am, standing on the same track I did in High school. I can see him run around the track, younger him, the younger me.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-some-examples-of-imagery-in-the-most-dangerous-game></span>What are some examples of imagery in the most dangerous game?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Vivid <b>Imagery</b> is using vivid, colorful, descriptive language that paints a mental picture in the mind of the reader. <b>Example</b>: Rainsford’s terror was about to burst his heart as he watched Zaroff smoke standing below the tree. <b>Example</b>: The dank tropical forest loomed at the edge of the blood-warm ocean.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-two-examples-of-personification-in-the-most-dangerous-game></span>What are two examples of personification in the most dangerous game?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>1. “Trying to peer through the dank tropical night that was palpable as it pressed its thick warm blackness in upon the yacht” is an <b>example of personification</b> based upon the fact that the night is pressing itself (its warm thick blackness”) on the yacht. Darkness cannot press itself upon something.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-metaphor-in-the-most-dangerous-game></span>What is a metaphor in the most dangerous game?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>For example, in “The <b>Most Dangerous Game</b>,” the narrator says of Rainsford, “The Cossack was the cat. He was the mouse.” This <b>metaphor</b> indicates Rainsford’s position of helplessness and being toyed with as he was hunted by Zaroff.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-the-night-would-be-my-eyelids-a-metaphor></span>Is the night would be my eyelids a metaphor?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Metaphor</b>. Connell uses <b>metaphors</b> to create a comparison that says so much in just a few words. In the dark of <b>night</b>, when Rainsford was talking about falling asleep, he says, ” the <b>night would be my eyelids</b>.” He was saying that the <b>night</b> was so dark, it was as if his eyes were closed.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-theme-of-the-most-dangerous-game></span>What is the theme of The Most Dangerous Game?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The central <b>theme of “The Most Dangerous Game</b>” is murder. Its main characters, Sangor Rainsford and General Zaroff, are both hunters, and Rainsford justifies killing by claiming that animals can’t feel.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-mood-in-the-most-dangerous-game></span>What is the mood in the most dangerous game?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>The <b>mood</b> of “The <b>Most Dangerous Game</b>” is suspenseful.</b><ul class=i8Z77e><li class=TrT0Xe>The name of the island is Ship-Trap Island, a place that sailors dread.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Multiple references to darkness.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>The chase moves fast.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-mood-when-rainsford-is-on-the-boat></span>What is the mood when Rainsford is on the boat?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The <b>tone</b> and <b>mood</b> of “The Most Dangerous Game” is suspense. Each situation is set up to provide the maximum amount of fear and anticipation in the reader, from <b>Rainsford’s</b> initial fall off his <b>ship</b> to his discovery of Zaroff’s true purpose and the knowledge that he will be next in the hunt.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-rainsford-yacht-headed-for></span>Where is Rainsford yacht headed for?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>“The Most Dangerous Game” opens with a conversation between two men, Whitney and <b>Rainsford</b>. The pair are on a <b>yacht headed to</b> Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. At the time of the story, they find themselves somewhere in the Caribbean. Both men are aficionados of big-game hunting.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-does-zaroff-think-rainsford-is-droll-and-naive></span>Why does zaroff think Rainsford is droll and naïve?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>He is beastly by nature. So when he first meets Rainford who is a very intelligent man and a great hunter who had fallen off his yacht <b>Zaroff</b> underestimates him. He finds him <b>droll and naive</b> like most sailors.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-zaroff-think-of-rainsford></span>What does zaroff think of Rainsford?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Zaroff</b> believes that <b>Rainsford</b> has cheated his way out of playing the game by circumventing its rules. By throwing himself off the cliff—and presumably hurtling to his death—<b>Rainsford</b> had managed to prevent <b>Zaroff</b> from experiencing the “victory” of locating and killing him.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46er5qloKGytHnOn2Sfp6KawKmtw6iuoqaXYravedOhnGaln6jBbrDAp56eqp%2BqwG6zwKacaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
