Depp was casually dressed for her flight, wearing a cropped white tee with no bra underneath and black sweatpants. She attempted to conceal her identity with a pair of sunglasses. Now that she's achieved TV star status, however, it'll be nearly impossible for the blonde beauty to blend in with the crowd. Especially once The Idol makes its world debut in the coming weeks.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-lily-rose-depp-at-the-idol-premiere>Lily-Rose Depp at The Idol Premiere</h2></span><p>Abel 'The Weeknd' Tesfaye and Lily-Rose Depp attend "The Idol" photocall on May 23, 2023, in Cannes, France.

Even with the scathing reviews slamming the hypersexualization of Depp's pop star character, she seems far more focused on the love unfolding in front of her. According to The Hollywood Reporter, there are hardly any scenes "without the camera showing flashes of [Lily's] breasts or ass."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"You start to wonder if this is building to anything, and by episode two it seems likely that it’s probably not," they further noted. Rolling Stone previously shared similar criticisms of the show, but The Weeknd and his co-star <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">didn't seem bothered</a> by those either.
