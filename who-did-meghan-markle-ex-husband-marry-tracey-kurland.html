Everything about Meghan was relentlessly scrutinized at the time, including her ex <a href=#>Trevor, a literary agent, talent manager, and film producer</a>.</p><p>Trevor's second wife, Tracey Kurland, is a nutritionist whom he wed in 2019. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She is notable for her affluent background due to her wealthy father, businessman Stanford Kurland,</a> according to The Daily Mail.

He studied journalism. But a career behind the scenes in the film industry evidently appealed to him more.</p><p>Trevor's first job was as a production assistant. It gave him a beginner's foothold in the heady world of cinema and allowed him to acquire a grasp of the basics. It may also have indirectly led to Trevor's first meeting with Meghan because it put him in her geographical and professional territory.</p><p>Her career as an actress was revving up in 2004 when she and Trevor are believed to have first found each other. Both were young and ambitious. Each was definitely going places. The romantic pairing of these two seemed natural and began promisingly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ttweb_meghan-markle-s-net-worth-since-quitting-the-royal-family-is-actually-higher-than-you-think_bk_a1_v3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Meghan Markle’s Net Worth Since Quitting The Royal Family Is Actually Higher Than You Think</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Thanks to her Podcast, Netflix deal and other ventures in the works, Meghan Markle is doing more than okay nowadays.</span><p>The first nuptials of the future Duchess of Sussex in 2011 were reportedly far more rollicking than solemn and stately like her wedding to Prince Harry at Windsor Castle. That magnificent site is steeped in history, grandeur, and royal tradition, as was their wedding.</p><p>The <a href=#>Markle-Engelson nuptials featured four days of uninhibited revelry</a> and fun on a beach with 200 guests in Ocho Rios, Jamaica. Meghan reportedly kicked up her heels in a bikini. Marijuana and alcohol allegedly were on hand to fuel the marital festivities.</p><p>But the couple's wedded bliss eventually soured. Some have speculated that the marriage became unsustainable after Meghan's role as Rachel Zane in Suits took her to Toronto for filming, far from Trevor, who was based in Los Angeles.</p><p>Andrew Morton, who has written about the royal family frequently, claimed Meghan abruptly quit the marriage and mailed her wedding and engagement rings back to Trevor to underscore her intentions, per The Daily Mail. They were apparently on the rocks as a married couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=trevor-went-on-to-date-bethenny-frankel><strong>Trevor Went On To Date Bethenny Frankel</strong></h2><p>For a while, after Trevor and Meghan split, he was associated with another famous woman.
