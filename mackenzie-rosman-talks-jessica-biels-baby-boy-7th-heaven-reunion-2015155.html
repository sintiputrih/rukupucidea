Mackenzie Rosman is ready to meet little Silas. The 7th Heaven alum opened up to Us Weekly about her former TV family, but admitted that she has yet to see Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake’s 1-month-old son.
“I don’t really get to see them all that often. They all live in different parts of the country, actually,” Rosman, 25, told Us at the Reality TV Awards in Hollywood on Wednesday, May 13."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The 7th Heaven alum opened up to <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly </strong></a>about her former TV family, but admitted that she has yet to see<strong> <a href=#>Jessica Biel</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Justin Timberlake’s</a> </strong>1-month-old son.</p><p>“I don’t really get to see them all that often. They all live in different parts of the country, actually,” Rosman, 25, told <strong>Us</strong> at the Reality TV Awards in Hollywood on Wednesday, May 13. “<strong>Beverley [Mitchell]</strong> spends a lot of time in Colorado and Jessie is in — somewhere with Justin! She’s always somewhere.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Indeed, Biel and Timberlake have been all over, but they may soon settle down out of the spotlight. As <strong>Us </strong>exclusively revealed, the new parents plan to nest at their Yellowstone Club estate in Big Sky, Montana.</p><p>Rosman hasn’t met Mitchell’s 3-month-old baby boy Hutton, either. “Actually I’ve only met Kenzie, which is funny! Kenzie Lynne is her name!” the actress said of Mitchell’s 2-year-old daughter. “I know her mother-in-law’s name is Marilynne, but still, she took part of my name. I’m flattered. We’re all so busy, you get to see a kid once a year sometimes.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Rosman played Ruthie Camden on the beloved family drama alongside Biel, 33, (Mary Camden) and Mitchell, 34, (Lucy Camden) from 1996 to 2007. Since then, the costars have reunited on occasion (weddings and baby showers, galore!), with the most recent get-together <a href=#>in September 2014. </a>Rosman, however, wasn’t in attendance.</p><p>“I was so bummed to have missed the last dinner! They planned it and I had a trip to the East Coast planned and at the last minute it moved and I was on a flight 12 hours before that. I was so bummed,” she told <strong>Us</strong>.</p><p>At the time, Biel and Mitchell grabbed grub with <strong>David Gallagher </strong>(Simon Camden), <strong>Barry Watson </strong>(Matt Camden), <strong>Catherine Hicks</strong> (Annie Camden), and<strong> Stephen Collins</strong>, who played Reverend Eric Camden. (Collins admitted to his history of sexual abuse in December.)</p><p>“We would all love to see each other again,” Rosman shared with <strong>Us</strong>, noting that Mitchell is the center of the “pinwheel” that helps to keep tabs on everyone. “Bev is the one who is the really great organizer, so that hadn’t happened for a few years before that, but we all just have to coordinate. It’s hard coordinating a group of seven people or more, depending on who can come, so next time the stars align. It would be fun though.”</p><p>She added: “I miss the whole crew, everybody. It’s a 100-person family.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammZOgsq%2FGyJ5kq6ejoq6vedOao6SrXZ%2BytL%2FInJhmmpmaubR5wZqZsmWSpMZug9OhZKGdkauyr3nRnqynoZ%2BjenN8kG5obm1f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
