One of the world’s most famous stars, the beloved actor has made more than 100 movies in an impressive career that’s spanned more four decades, and made Hanks one of the most successful actors in history, with his films earning more than $9.96&nbsp;billion worldwide. He’s won two Oscars, seven Emmys, and a Tony, not to mention an AFI Lifetime Achievement Award and a Presidential Medal of Freedom. And he’s a member of the coveted SNL five-timers club, which means he owns one of those sweet five-timer smoking jackets along with Tina Fey and Paul Rudd.

The man won back-to-back consecutive Oscars for Philadelphia and Forrest Gump, and he’s been nominated five times for Best Actor, and once for Best Supporting Actor. When it comes to Emmys, he’s even more accomplished. He’s been nominated a whopping 13 times, winning awards for his work on From the Earth to the Moon, Band of Brothers, John Adams, The Pacific, Game Change, and Olive Kitteridge. In 2020, the Golden Globes awarded Hanks the celebrated Cecil B. DeMille Award for his “outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment.”</p><p data-characters=568 data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true>Those are just some of his accomplishments in the biz, but Hanks is a man of many pursuits. He’s starred in a Carly Rae Jepsen music video, been ordained as a minister, and even released his own app. Yes, you read that right. Hanks has an app. The typewriter fanatic released Hanx Writer, an app which mimics the experience of using a typewriter. And wouldn’t you know it — within days, it reached number one on the App Store. But that’s just Tom Hanks for you. So just how many movies has Mr. Hanks been in, and what are they?

The former Apollo 13 star is currently co-writing and narrating&nbsp;The Moonwalkers, an immersive art exhibition in London based around the stories of the Apollo space missions. Hanks would love to head up to space himself, telling&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Telegraph</a>, “I’m your man. I would probably sign up right now! That might be a good idea, I’ll do all the work. I’ll clean the toilet. I’ll serve the food. I’ll fold clothes. I’ll stow the gear. That way the others could be free to do other stuff.”</p><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=false>And there’s good news for Toy Story fans on the horizon. On February 8, 2023, Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed sin a quarterly earnings call for the studio that Toy Story 5 had been greenlit, and was in active development. Iger didn’t confirm Hanks’ participation, but since the actor has starred in movies 1-4, it’s a good guess he’ll be the star of the upcoming installment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SurbiMqJ1mrJ%2BieqmtzaSqZqWfq7amv4yipWanopmys3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
