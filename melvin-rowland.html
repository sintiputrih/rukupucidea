Melvin was born in the city of New York. There is no information available about Melvin’s biological parents, siblings, or other family members. However, according to the hearing recordings, an elderly couple adopted Melvin but died when he was young.</p><p>Melvin later went to a state-run group home. He then attended a private boarding school in Colorado, where he graduated with honors. Melvin then spent time at a Buddhist institute in Berkeley, California. He also enrolled in Jobs Corps and attended Salt Lake Community College. Melvin also worked as a certified nursing assistant.</p><h2><span id=Career_and_Professional_Life>Career and Professional Life</span></h2><p>Melvin Rowland worked as a former agent for a company called Andronicus, LLC. He also rose to prominence as a convicted sex offender. In 2004, Melvin was found guilty of forcible sexual abuse and enticing a minor by the authorities. In addition, he is the murderer of Lauren McCluskey.</p><p>Lauren was a student-athlete at the University of Utah. Melvin and Lauren had only been dating for a month before the fateful incident. Lauren ended her relationship with Melvin on October 9, 2018, after learning about his previous criminal charges.</p><p>In terms of the unfortunate night of Lauren’s murder, it occurred as Lauren was returning to her university apartment from a night class. Lauren was on the phone with her mother, Jill, at the time of the incident, as she later revealed.</p><p>Lauren had only filed a police report against Melvin a week before her death. The police, however, were unable to take action because Melvin’s correct address was not available to them, as revealed by University of Utah police chief Dale Brophy.</p><p>Melvin committed suicide only an hour after killing Lauren, as police officers closed in. While Lauren’s body was discovered in the back seat of a parked car near a campus residential hall, Melvin’s body was discovered in a church in Salt Lake City. Melvin died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after the authorities surrounded him.</p><h2><span id=Net_worth><span class="TextRun BCX8 SCXW154258235" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=none><span class="NormalTextRun BCX8 SCXW154258235">Net worth</span></span></span></h2><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>Melvin Rowland estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
