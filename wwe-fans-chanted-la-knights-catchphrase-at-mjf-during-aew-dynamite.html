During AEW Dynamite this week, MJF’s promo received a dose of WWE from fan chants.</p><p>WWE’s standout star, LA Knight, continues to gather more support with each week, and that’s not changing. It appears that there were quite a few LA Knight fans in the crowd during AEW Dynamite this week.</p><p>LA Knight has captured the attention of the WWE Universe, who now enthusiastically echo his “Yeah” chant during his promos, just like Stone Cold’s “What?” chants. While this became a regular feature of Knight’s promos, it appears that followers of AEW are also adopting this trend.</p><p>One fan with an LA Knight X account called @YEAHMovement_, took to social media to highlight that the “Yeah” chants made an appearance even during MJF’s Dynamite promo.</p><p>This is incredible. The crowd on #AEWDynamite said “YEAH” during @The_MJF’s promo tonight. The #YEAHMovement truly is taking over the world of professional wrestling.</p><p>In a noteworthy development, MJF and Adam Cole are slated to clash for the AEW World Championship at the All In event. Fans will need to tune into the pay-per-view to see how everything goes down.</p><p>LA Knight’s popularity is also causing fans to go through his old footage. <a href=#>Video of Paul Bearer’s final performance before his passing has resurfaced recently,</a> and LA Knight was right alongside the WWE Hall of Famer. Odds are, LA Knight will create many more memories to come down the line.</p><p>What’s your take on this situation with LA Knight’s YEAH? Will fans soon take it and make it something bigger than just WWE?
