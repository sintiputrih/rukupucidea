Since day one, the biggest squad size featured in Apex Legends has been three players. There’s also the option to drop in solo or in duos… but what if we had even bigger options?
Apparently, that idea seems to be a popular one, as it was a subject that skyrocketed to the top of the Apex subreddit on January 7."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It might not be the most balanced mode, but having larger teams than normal seems to be a popular idea.</p><p>“I want four, 15 man squads to fight it out.

Just think about the challenges of finding enough ammo with three people; now just imagine getting enough for five people with the same weapon.</p><p>Adding a mode with five person squads, or even doing something like Fortnite’s Team Rumble — where the whole lobby is split into just two teams — would certainly shake things up. It’s just an idea for now, but who knows?
