When his father joined the Phillies in 1979, Rose Jr. spent time with Aaron Boone, Bret Boone, Ryan Luzinski, and Mark McGraw in the Phillies clubhouse. He appeared on a 1982 Fleer baseball card (#640) titled “Pete & Re-Pete; Pete Rose & son” with his father; he was twelve at the time.

He hit .308 in 112 games with 25 home runs, 98 RBIs, 31 doubles and 75 runs scored for the Lookouts. Later that year, Rose was called up to the Cincinnati Reds for his first and only time in the major leagues. He hit only .143 in just 11 games for the Reds, but was widely shown on popular sports highlight shows when he copied his dad’s famous crouching batting stance during the first pitch of his first Major League at-bat.
