No one is taking the title of the best lightweight boxer away from Vasyl Lomachenko. He showed that in his unanimous victory against Luke Campbell to take the WBC title, adding to his WBA, WBO, and Ring titles.</p><p>But there are two lightweight fighters making names for themselves, and they could be in that conversation with the 31-year-old Ukrainian before too long: Devin Haney and Ryan Garcia.&nbsp;Haney has begun his professional boxing career as clean as they come with a 22-0 record, 14 victories coming by knockout.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-914 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Garcia who is 22 years old has opened his professional career with a spotless 18-0 record — 15 wins by knockout. Both look to keep their perfect record intact as Haney fights Zaur Abdullaev on Friday and Garcia fights Avery Sparrow on Saturday, both live on DAZN.</p><p>With Lomachenko not fighting again until 2020, possibly taking on the winner of the Richard Commey-Teofimo Lopez bout for a chance at unification, the WBC has said Haney’s fight against Abdullaev would have an interim lightweight title on the line. “His upside is incredible. It’s exponential. By the time he’s 21, he could be a champion,” Doulgass Fischer, editor in chief of The Ring magazine, told DAZN.</p><h2 id=h-devin-haney-vs-santiago>Devin Haney Vs Santiago</h2><p>Haney won a twelve-round unanimous decision over Alfredo Santiago(previously undefeated) in his first defense of the WBC lightweight title. In the early going, It was a calculated boxing match. Haney was given some trouble by Santiago’s style. When they got in close there was a lot of holding and wrestling.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-915 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Haney started to get more accurate with his punches in the fifth. He dropped Santiago with a combination after landing a solid hook. By the sixth Santiago recovered and boxed well in the round.</p><p>He went back to boxing with sharper and more accurate punches In the seventh. He continued to control the action as Santiago was sluggish and there was a lot of clinching between the two as the fight continued.</p><h2 id=h-devin-haney-lomachenko>Devin Haney Lomachenko</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Haney is confident that he can knock him off. Haney does see flaws in him that Lomachenko can capitalise on. One deciding factor – his jab. Haney feels like he has got the best jab in the game and his jab separates him from everyone.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-916 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>Being honest, He has not played the fight out in his head because the fight has not been set in stone. It does not look like it’s going to be made next. Haney thinks that his strengths match up great, that’s why he feels like he could beat him. He feels like he is faster, stronger and bigger. He added that he feels like he is better overall. Davin said that he was 20 years old, and he is growing into his man’s strength and it’s showing in his fights.</p><p>Haney went into his last fight(before Santiago) and broke his opponent’s orbital bone at just 20-years-old, so he is only getting stronger. He is only getting better. Haney was a very interested observer when Lomachenko won a tough decision over fellow Olympic gold medal winner Luke Campbell.</p><p>He thought it was a good fight. According to Haney, he thinks Lomachenko showed some flaws. Luke Campbell done well, he used his jab, he landed some good body shots. He did not do enough to win, but in spots, he did well.</p><p>Haney obtained a boxing promoter’s license by the California State Athletic Commission (CSAC). This made him the youngest boxing promoter in the sport! Haney was considered by many pundits as one of the top prospects in boxing. His victory in a Showtime debut bout was a ninth-round knockout in sensational fashion against Mason Menard.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-917 data-method=placement-service></span><p>The IBF #15 rated boxer returned to the ring against a title contender, Juan Carlos Burgos (32-2-2, 21KOs). Many boxing pundits see this fight as the toughest of his career so far. In addition, the bout was the first promoted ght of Devin Haney Promotions. Shobox featured this contest as part of another competitive triple-header card on September 28.2019 in California.</p><h2 id=h-devin-haney-weigh-in>Devin Haney Weigh In</h2><p>Devin Haney (22-0, 14 KOs) weighed in successfully at 134.6 pounds (ca. 61 kg) for his fight against Zaur Abdullaev (11-0, 7 KOs) on DAZN at Madison Square Garden in New York. Abdullaev, 25, weighed in at 134.6 lbs. Haney and Abdullaevfought in a WBC lightweight title eliminator. They fought for the interim WBC 135-lb title.</p><p>Haney won the fight and became mandatory for WBC champion Vasyl Lomachenko. However, his promoter Bob Arum of Top Rank Boxing said that Lomachenko won’t fight for the remainder of 2019 and that in 2020 he will be waiting to face the Richard Commey vs. Teofimo Lopez fight.</p><h2 id=h-devin-haney-purses>Devin Haney Purses</h2><p>Haney vs Javier Fortuna Ordered, Purse Bid on December 13.2019. The advice was given to BoxingScene.com Devin Haney, WBC lightweight champion (24-0, 15 KOs) has been ordering to make a mandatory defense against Javier Fortuna (35-2-1, 24 KOs). If there is no agreement reached between the two sides, then a purse bid will take place on December 13 in Mexico City.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-918 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Haney made his first defense last Saturday night at Staples Center in Los Angeles, when he dominated unbeaten Alfredo Santiago over twelve rounds on the KSI-Paul Logan undercard. In September, Haney captured the WBC’s interim-lightweight title with a fourth-round stoppage of Zaur Abdullaev. As a holder of the interim-belt, he was in line to fight the WBC’s full champion, Vasiliy Lomachaneko.</p><p>Haney was automatically elevated to full champion when the sanctioning body made Lomachenko their “franchise” champion at lightweight. The franchise champion has no mandatory obligations and more importantly is unable to lose the “franchise” status if defeated. Because he was elevated to full status without a fight, Haney is obligated to make two mandatory defenses. Fortuna is the first.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><h2 id=h-frequently-asked-questions-about-devin-haney>Frequently Asked Questions About Devin Haney</h2><strong class=schema-faq-question>Who is Devin Haney?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Devin Haney is an acclaimed Professional Boxer, who is widely known for holding the WBC lightweight title since 2019.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question><span id=How_old_is_XYZAll_Names>How old is Devin Haney?</span></strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Haney is an American national born on 17th November 1998, in San Francisco, CA.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-919 data-method=placement-service></span> <strong class=schema-faq-question><span id=How_tall_is_XYZAll_Names>How tall is Devin Haney?</span></strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Devin stands at a height of 1.73&nbsp;m.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question><span id=Is_XYZ_marriedAll_Names>Is Devin Haney married?</span></strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>No, over the course of his life, Haney has been in relationships with some of America’s most celebrated stars, including Jania Jackson and Aileen Gisselle.
