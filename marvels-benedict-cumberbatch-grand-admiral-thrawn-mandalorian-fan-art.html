The design, which you can see below, comes from digital artist ApexForm, who wrote in his Instagram caption:</p><p>“With recent revelations in @themandalorian chapter 13, it’s only a matter of time before we see the live action debut of Admiral Thrawn. But the real question? Who will play him? My choice is Benedict Cumberbatch. He has the look, and the acting ability to play calculated and sinister.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/128667094_380364469906126_1582785670802606511_n.jpg><p data-characters=583 data-current-count=583 data-injectable=true>Of course, it would be ironic if Cumberbatch played Thrawn on The Mandalorian, as the last actor to bring him to life – Rebels’&nbsp;Lars Mikkelsen – appeared opposite the MCU regular in the BBC’s Sherlock.&nbsp;But is this a casting that’s likely to happen? Well, Cumberbatch’s known to be a big Star Wars&nbsp;fan and he was routinely rumored to be up for roles in the Sequel Trilogy. He might be too busy to commit to a supporting part in the Disney Plus show, though, as he’s doubling up as Stephen Strange in both Spider-Man 3 and Doctor Strange 2.</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>Thrawn was last seen in the&nbsp;Rebels&nbsp;series finale, with both him and enemy Jedi Ezra Bridger going missing. We can assume that Ahsoka is after the big bad on <strong>The Mandalorian</strong>&nbsp;as part of her ongoing search to locate Ezra and it seems like this plotline will either be of greater importance in season 3 or else it’ll be the thrust of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a spinoff show for Dawson’s heroine</a>.</p><p data-characters=93 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=false>But tell us, would you like to see Cumberbatch as Thrawn?
