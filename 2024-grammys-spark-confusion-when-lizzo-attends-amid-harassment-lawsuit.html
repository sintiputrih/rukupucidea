“What’s up, everybody?” Lizzo, 35, exclaimed as she walked onto the stage, dancing to her “About Damn Time” single. “Here’s the Grammy Award that’s gone to the all-time greats, from Stevie Wonder to Prince to Alicia Keys to Beyoncé, these are our soulfully gifted nominees for Best R&B Song.”
Lizzo, dressed in a strapless leather dress, ultimately presented the trophy to an emotional SZA."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Another added, “After what Lizzo did she was invited to the #Grammys?”</p><p class=p1>A third pointed out, “If #LIZZO was a GUY, she wouldn’t be presenting an award at the Grammys! With alll those allegations she’s facing n getting ready to go to [trial].”</p><p class=p1>Others, meanwhile, slammed the Recording Academy for letting Lizzo take the stage.</p><p class=p1>“Shoutout to the Grammys for allowing Lizzo to present an award mid sexual assault charges,” an X user quipped. “Great work guys! #NoAccountabilitySociety.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Social-Media-Is-Very-Confused-by-Lizzo-Presenting-at-the-Grammys-Following-Harassment-Lawsuit-667.jpg><p class=p1>Another viewer pointed out, however: “It’s amazing that Lizzo was able to present that #GRAMMYs to SZA as that’s been her friend for many years now.”</p><p class=p1><i>Us Weekly </i>confirmed in August 2023 that three of Lizzo’s former backup dancers <a href=#>named her in a lawsuit</a>, claiming that she fostered a hostile work environment and promoted religious harassment, disability discrimination and sexual harassment.</p><p class=p1>Lizzo <a href=#>denied the allegations</a> later that month.</p><p class=p1>“These last few days have gut-wrenchingly difficult and overwhelmingly disappointing. My work ethic, morals and respectfulness have been questioned. My character has been criticized,” she wrote in a lengthy Instagram statement, calling the allegations “false,” “unbelievable” and “too outrageous not to be addressed.”</p><p class=p1>The singer continued: “These sensationalized stories are coming from former employees who have already publicly admitted that they were told their behavior on tour was inappropriate and unprofessional. As an artist, I have always been very passionate about what I do. I take my music and my performances seriously because, at the end of the day, I only want to put out the best art that represents me and my fans.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>One month later, Lizzo’s former wardrobe stylist <strong>Asha Daniels</strong> filed her own harassment lawsuit with similar claims. (Lizzo did not address the accusations at the time.)</p><p class=p1>“We are going to go through the litigation process because Lizzo has not accepted any responsibility. She’s denied all these allegations,” <strong>Neama Rahmani</strong>, an attorney whose West Coast Trial Lawyers firm is representing all the plaintiffs, <a href=#>exclusively told <i>Us</i></a> in September 2023. “Her lawyers have come out and attacked our clients, calling them liars. This isn’t a situation where a celebrity makes a mistake [and] they come out and they apologize and they try to make things right. This is a celebrity [who] has denied any of this despite all these victims who have come forward and who will continue to come forward.”</p><p class=p1>Lizzo has kept a low profile since the scandal. She <a href=#>returned to the red carpet</a> for the first time in November 2023 at the premiere of Beyoncé’s <i>Renaissance </i>tour documentary in Los Angeles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaGlpamRitLOtzKawrGWjpa6zt4ycpqeepai2sLqMsJ%2Bepl2htrvGzmaYrayVo7G0ecCmoJ1lmJa%2For%2FSppynrF2hrri%2F1KKraA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
