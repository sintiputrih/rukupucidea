There is nothing wrong with divorce anymore, especially when a marriage isn’t working out for the parties involved.
However, when you’ve built your whole political platform around nuclear family values, it’s reasonable that people would be surprised to learn that you’ve served your spouse with divorce papers.
Lauren Boebert of Colorado is a prime example."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Was her husband, Jayson Boebert, really cleaning his rifle and sipping a tall glass of beer as he was presented with divorce papers? When did the pair first meet? Here’s what we know.</p><h2><strong>Who Is Lauren Boebert Husband, Jayson Boebert?</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ghbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lauren.jpg><p>Lauren met her spouse (now ex-husband), Jayson Boebert when she was 16 and he was 22. According to Lauren’s memoirs (via Insider), it was love at first sight for the Colorado lawmaker, who wrote, “He just took my breath away.”</p><p>I instantly fell in love with Jayson, and I knew without a doubt that he was the guy I was intended to be with – for better or worse – forever.”</p><p>Jayson initially met Lauren while working on an oil rig. In March 2005, the couple had their first child, a boy named Tyler. Jayson and Lauren married three months later and have been together ever since.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2><strong>Why does Lauren want a divorce?</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Jayson and Lauren had gone through a lot together (four kids, getting arrested, etc.), so what was the breaking point?</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Lauren kept the circumstances of her divorce quiet, saying, “I am grateful for our years of marriage together and for our beautiful children, all of whom deserve privacy and love as we work through this process.” I’ve always been loyal in my marriage, and I truly believe in marriage…”</p><p>“Which makes this announcement all the more difficult,” she said. This is a case of irreconcilable disagreements.” Lauren began her statement by stating that she was the one who filed for divorce.</p><h2><strong>Lauren Boebert has four kids — how old are they?</strong></h2><p>Lauren’s son Tyler, who will become a father in April, will be 17 years old in March 2023. Tyler had a spot-on reaction to Lauren when she informed him he was making her a 36-year-old grandma, according to a speech Lauren delivered at a CPAC Women’s Breakfast event, asking, “Well, didn’t you make Granny [Lauren’s mother] a 36-year old granny?”</p><p>Lauren, who gave birth to Tyler while she was an adolescent, accepted the truth in her son’s story. Tyler laughed, “Well, then, it’s hereditary.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Lauren has three additional boys in addition to Tyler. Lauren has four boys ages 10 to 17, according to her website’s official biography, so it’s reasonable to believe Tyler is her eldest son (particularly considering they joked about the 36-year-old grandmother’s problem repeating again).</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdoa62vsSnZJunlZeys8CMoaysmpGjsW62wLKqqKZdl7ymrsSrq2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
