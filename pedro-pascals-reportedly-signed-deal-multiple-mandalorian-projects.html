Recommended Videos The actor inked a first position deal with HBO, and in industry terms that means The Last of Us instantly became his number one priority and took precedence over any of his other film and television commitments, including Disney Plus’ Star Wars smash hit, so if they don’t want him to show up on set in Din Djarin’s armor, then they’ve got the contractual right to stop it from happening."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Scheduling for Guardians of the Galaxy overlapped with Parks and Rec‘s sixth season, and showrunner Mike Schur could have technically blocked Pratt from playing Star-Lord, but a compromise was reached, which is why Andy Dwyer is in London for the season 6 premiere before disappearing for a few episodes, because that’s where James Gunn’s Guardians was shooting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mandalorian-season-two-moff-gideon.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mandalorian-season-two-tuskan-raider.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EhZPgX2XkAAnUWX.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EhZPgxcXgAEF00W.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/star-wars-mandalorian-season-2-photo5-1236174.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/star-wars-mandalorian-season-2-photo4-1236175.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/star-wars-mandalorian-season-2-photo3-1236176.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/star-wars-mandalorian-season-2-photo2-1236177.jpeg><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>However, insider Daniel Richtman is now reporting that Pascal has signed a new deal for multiple projects related to The Mandalorian that will see him show up all over the small screen Star Wars universe. Taking to his Patreon account, the tipster wrote: “Pedro signed [a] huge deal to be in multiple projects as Mando.”</p><p data-characters=554 data-current-count=886 data-injectable=false>If the 45 year-old has in fact agreed to a new contract with Lucasfilm, though, then it’s not going to bear any fruit for a while yet. After all, The Last of Us starts shooting in Calgary this July, and isn’t set to wrap until eleven months later. And given HBO’s first position status and the distance between the console adaptation’s location and <strong>The Mandalorian</strong>‘s California home, Pascal would need to hit the recording booth with a vengeance between now and then to lend his vocal talents to future Star Wars adventures.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yxscOrpmaokaiworjSZqmeqJ%2Bnwaawy7JkrKGXo7KlecOemKVlnaq5tbXPpZxmpZGjsaK4zqugmqZdpb%2BwtsScq6xn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
