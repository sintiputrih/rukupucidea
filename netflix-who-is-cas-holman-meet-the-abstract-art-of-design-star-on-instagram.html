It was such a success that it was commissioned to be designed for schools and playgrounds. Then Cas started to sell Rigmajig for families in their homes.</p><p>Find out more about Rigmajig on&nbsp;<span style=text-decoration:underline><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their website</a>.</span></p><ul><li><span style=text-decoration:underline><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">READ MORE</a>:</strong></span> Styling Hollywood: Who is John Mumblo?
