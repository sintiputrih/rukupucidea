The Picard Family and Chase have been an essential part of this league since its beginning ten years ago, and they need our help during this terrible time. A contribution to this cause would be much appreciated. Our thoughts are with Ashley, Jeremy, and the boys as they grapple with the unimaginable loss they have endured.</p><p>You can rely on the Hooksett Flag Community to help you! Chase was a kind, hardworking, and kind young guy who cared deeply for his parents and brothers. Athlete with exceptional talent. Baseball, basketball, and flag football were among his favorite sports. A significant portion of my evenings and weekends were spent attending sporting activities. Ashley has dedicated her entire life to caring for young children, as many of you are aware.</p><p>She has made a positive impact on many people’s lives and is always prepared to provide a helping hand to those in need. Jeremy is not only a well-known member of our community, but he also gives his time to coach his children in a number of sporting events. I frequently coach additional teams to ensure that young people in our community always have a team to play on. The death of a child is indescribable, and no parent should ever have to go through it.</p><p>We are all devastated by this awful loss and the premature death of a life. Please assist us in offering assistance to the Picard family during this terribly trying time. I’d like to thank everyone ahead of time.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwr8eaqp5loJ6wor7DZpqaql2WsKS1w56lrWWYpLysv8Stq2ammGK5oq%2FRqKqsnV2XrrSxwZqjpWWgoa66sdFmoqKknJqxbrXNZqOoppSku6Wx0auwZqaYZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
