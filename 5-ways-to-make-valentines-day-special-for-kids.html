WRITE THEM VALENTINE’S DAY LETTERS</b>.</span> Tell them all the things you love about them. Here are some great ideas for specific compliments you can give them —&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span><a href=#>99 Kids Compliments</a>.&nbsp;</span></strong>If you have more than one child, have your kids write valentines to each other. &nbsp;I found glitter hearts of various sizes in a package at Hobby Lobby (also seen at Michael’s and Target) and glued an envelope on the back with their name on it. I took red and white twine and hung each of them from the ceiling.</p><p>My Mom always hung them in the entry of our home but mine are hung over my dining room table. My kids can’t wait to run downstairs in the morning to find their envelopes filled with notes! My Mom raised 5 boys and 1 girl (me) and to this day, my brothers will tell you that they loved reading their notes on Valentine’s Day.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DSC_0730ed.jpg alt="5 ways to make Valentine's Day special for kids" width=3834 height=3008 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span><strong>2. MAKE A SPECIAL VALENTINE’S DAY BREAKFAST</strong>.</span> Growing up, my Mom made sure we had <strong><span>pink pancakes, pink milk, and even pink eggs</span></strong>. Our tradition is to serve strawberry milk, Goldie’s pancakes with fresh strawberries, and homemade whipped cream. &nbsp;The kids get strawberry milk once a year and they look forward to this breakfast. I usually set the table the night before, after the kids go to bed.

They are about $1-2 for a big package and you can put the hearts on their plate and write their names on them or you can tape the hearts on the walls to make it look festive. You can find them at the Dollar store, Michael’s, Hobby Lobby, JoAnn’s, Walmart, and sometimes Target. The mailboxes can be found in the dollar section of Target.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DSC_0593-copy.jpg alt="Goldie's Buttermilk Pancakes. 5 Ways to Make Valentine's Special for Kids" width=4249 height=4000 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span>3. <strong>MAKE and DECORATE SUGAR COOKIES TOGETHER</strong>.</span> There is something about kids cutting out their own sugar cookies that they seem to really enjoy. Let them frost them with pink frosting and decorate them with a ridiculous amount of sprinkles.

WRAP a SMALL PRESENT</strong>.</span> &nbsp;It doesn’t have to be anything large or extravagant. My Mom usually bought me a brand new red shirt to wear to school. I try to buy something cute for my girls to wear and for my boys it may be a few Matchbox cars, a new game, or a ball to play with. It’s the thought that counts!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Feb-2011-090ed.jpg alt="5 ways to make Valentine's Day special for kids" width=3048 height=2741 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span>5.<strong>&nbsp;HAVE a SPECIAL VALENTINE’S DAY DINNER. </strong>Make a beautiful Valentine’s Day place setting or tablescape for a special dinner</span>.

Two years ago, we even mixed it up and <strong>made homemade pizzas together</strong> and last year we had a <strong>fondue party</strong>.

You can find Valentine’s Day at any store right now and I found most of this candy in the bulk section of Winco. This year, I placed it on top of a cake stand I found in the dollar section at Target for $3. Score!</p><p>My kids are on the countdown already….but if the wrappers I am finding around the house are any indication, they’ve already started. 🙂</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DSC_0671ed.jpg alt="5 ways to make Valentine's Day special for kids" width=3170 height=3072 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DSC_0670ed.jpg alt="5 ways to make Valentine's Day special for kids" width=3930 height=3072 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>These glitter hearts were found at Michael’s in a large package for less than $2. &nbsp;I decorate the walls with these too!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DSC_0661ed.jpg alt="5 ways to make Valentine's Day special for kids" width=4608 height=3072 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong><span>It doesn’t have to cost a lot of money to decorate a table</span></strong>.

I used to have to find old shoe boxes and decorate them but stores are making it so much easier! You can find medium or large boxes in Valentine’s day colors — red, white, and pink at Target, Hobby Lobby, or Michael’s. I just picked up medium ones at Michael’s and love the smaller size.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Decorating-Valentines-Day-Boxes-with-Pom-Poms.jpg alt="How to decorate Valentine's Day boxes with pom poms.
