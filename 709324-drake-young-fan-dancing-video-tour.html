The audience demographics at his It's All a Blur tour prove exactly that, as hip-hop heads both young and old have landed on Champagne Papi's "dialed in" Instagram Story series for having unmissable energy in the audience at his concerts. Several attendees have been fortunate enough to get up close and personal with the Toronto native since he hit the road with 21 Sav earlier this summer, and this past weekend, one young girl was lucky enough to get a TikTok with him.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In a viral video that looks to have been captured backstage, Drake sits with the child, both of them boldly dressed while grooving along to music. For his part, Aubrey Graham wore quilted purple pants under a white tee and a floral denim jacket. His co-star channelled Y2K vibes in a bright pink tracksuit, complete with a white t-shirt of her own underneath.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-no-one-loves-his-fans-quite-like-drake-does>No One Loves His Fans Quite Like Drake Does</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"In the club with my twin, we be vibin'," the viral sound playing over the adorable footage begins. "Classy b**ch, but they know I be outside with it." Behind his young friend, Drake appears to struggle to keep a straight face while chewing on a snack. "He doing everything except putting out <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the album</a> ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚," one IG user joked in @theneighborhoodtalk's comments. "I love my sista he really a vibeðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯," another person quipped.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">To the young girl in the video above, having the opportunity to meet Drake probably meant everything. Considering he recently gifted another fan $50K after they used their furniture money to buy tickets for his concert, it's likely nothing for the Canadian to spend a few minutes flexing with one of his listeners.
