Either you're too fat or you're too skinny …" continued Ashley before she was interrupted mid-sentence by Oprah with one of the most inappropriate questions to ask any teenage girl, ever!</p><p>"What size are you by the way?"</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-entertainment">Related articles</h2><p>Yes. Oprah really asked that.</p><p>"Size... ?" was all Ashley could say as she regained her composure before chiming in with an awkward rebuttal of "I'm Short", while Mary-Kate rambled a fairly unintelligible response to the horribly invasive question.</p><p>Then, it got worse. Oprah then decided to be sarcastic and dismissive, showing no sympathy for the twins or the complex relationship they clearly had with body image at the time.</p><p>Oprah quipped in a horribly sarcastic voice, to the giggling satisfaction of the audience: "Oh you're not sure? That's so interesting."</p><p>It wasn't funny then Oprah, and it definitely isn't now, with TikTok users erupting in rage.</p><p>"Oprah was so problematic," remarked one user. "This was handled so poorly," cried another.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"What the hell is wrong w Oprah (sic)," the outrage continued.</p><p>"Wow. That was messed up," another TikToker summed up the exchange perfectly.</p><p>It was really not okay. It is way past time to do better.</p><p>• <a href=#>0800 543 354 (0800 LIFELINE) or free text 4357 (HELP) (available 24/7)</a><br>• <a href=#>https://www.lifeline.org.nz/services/suicide-crisis-helpline</a><br>• <a href=#>YOUTHLINE</a>: 0800 376 633<br>• NEED TO TALK?
