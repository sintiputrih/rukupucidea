Fans who anticipated <a href=# class=text-word rel>Doja Cat</a>'s musical direction based on her feature on <a href=# class=text-word rel>SZA</a>'s "Kill Bill" remix were not mistaken. The new single, however, is not a drastic departure from her previous work. This comes despite Doja Cat herself <a href=# rel>teasing its distinctiveness</a>. While one might have expected something completely unexpected, the single still encapsulates the essence of Doja Cat's style. However, it expands upon it in the best way.</p><p>Aptly titled "<a href=# rel>Attention</a>," the sleek and seductive track delves into the theme of being in the spotlight. Doja Cat addresses the challenges she has faced and emphasizes that people are more interested in her personal life than her music. Anyone who follows her knows that it is a sentiment she has expressed in her online rants. Perhaps this frustration inspired her new creative direction. Doja Cat's flow is exceptional as she effortlessly navigates the sampled drums and dreamy harps. With lines like "I am not afraid to finally say sh*t with my chest," she fearlessly expresses her thoughts. The video for the single just might be Doja's best yet.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-doja-stands-out-in-a-crowd>Doja Stands Out In A Crowd</h2></span><p>Doja Cat brings a mix of old Hollywood, 90s rap, and current pop in the new video for "Attention." The video opens with Doja driving past a crowd of people who are screaming for her while flashbulbs go off. Eventually, she is shown walking down the sidewalks of Downtown LA, which we saw her filming a few weeks ago. People pass her as she raps to camera, and their faces eventually turn into terrifying nondescript molds, devoid of real features.</p><p>One of the most striking images in the video comes during the line where Doja says, "Look at me, look at me, I'm naked." Sure enough, there she is, almost fully nude but covered head to toe in blood. One thing is for certain, she is leaning into all of the rumors about sacrifices and Illuminati dealings. Doja has never shied away from it, but she has used it to her full advantage in the video. This is all while she is ripping her haters to shreds with her lyrics. Stylistically, it may not be as big of a jump as some wanted from Doja, but it wouldn't be far off to say this is her best work yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbYVzhY9mm6iikWKwosCMp5iknZRisLDCxKucnWWZo3qjuM6om2aZpKmyr8DIqKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
