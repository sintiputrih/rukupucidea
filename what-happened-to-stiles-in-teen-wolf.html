According to the Maze Runner alum, the decision was difficult to make, but ultimately it was for the best.</p><p>“The show couldn’t be more dear to me,” the 31-year-old actor said. “It was something I was trying to make work but it all happened very fast.”</p><p>Unfortunately, the stars were unable to align for Dylan. He insinuated that the process was chaotic, claiming that “they just kind of threw it at [them].” While they tried making it work, he eventually stepped back from the project.</p><p>“Ultimately, I just decided [the series] was left in a really good place for me and I still want to leave it there,” he said. “I wish them well and I’m going to watch it the first night it comes out. I hope it f—-ing kicks ass, but I’m not going to be in it.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tyler Posey Reveals Why Dylan O’Brien’s Absence In ‘Teen Wolf: The Movie’ Is ‘Complicated’ <a href=#>https://t.co/8nv3D0J5JT</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/aZiDjSRdiF</a></p>— Breaking Celebrity News (@BreakingCN) <a href=#>January 25, 2023</a></figure><p>Several months later, rumors began circulating that Dylan would make a cameo as Stiles Stilinski in Teen Wolf: The Movie.

What I've said is the truth.”</p><p>However, he understood why some came to the cameo conclusion in the first place. "My Jeep's in it," he revealed. "I lent them my Jeep for the movie.

During an August interview with Collider at San Diego Comic-Con, Davis discussed how they handled Dylan's absence.</p><p>“We don’t ignore it, but we reference it.
