It appears as if Parisian hottie, Marvin Anthony and Melinda Melrose are no more. The duo came about on the hit <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a> series, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Too Hot To Handle</strong></a>, where Marvin and Melinda instantly became fan favorites.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Lana kept the two apart, the two still managed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lose cash for a few kisses</a>, and then some, however, it's always worth it when you're literally too hot to handle! Amirite?</p><p>Well, it appears as if the tables have turned, and this time, in fellow co-star, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Peter Vigilante's</a> favor! While Peter may have been sent home early on, it seems as if he's gone on to be the true winner. Following the end of the series, Peter and Melinda announced their relationship, and here's what Marvin Anthony had to say.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>'Too Hot To Handle': Fans React To Peter's Rich Lifestyle And Mansion</a></span></p><h2 id=marvin-weighs-in-on-peter-amp-melinda-s-romance>Marvin Weighs In On Peter & Melinda's Romance</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Marvin Anthony and Melinda Melrose really had us thinking that they would have made it for the long run. Well, despite remaining together during the show, up until the season finale, it seems as if the two weren't truly made for one another.</p><p>While Marvin may have taken home the grand prize of $55,000, it was actually Peter Vigilante that took home his girl. How do you like them apples, Marvin?</p><p>Although Peter and Melinda's relationship sorta kinda maybe blossomed a bit on Too Hot To Handle, the New York native was actually sent home by Lana after she felt as if Peter wasn't making enough emotional bonds or connections with any of his housemates.</p><p>The TikTok star did manage to share a special kiss with Melinda during his time living at the villa, however, that was the last we saw of the two, or so we thought!</p><p>Following the show's wrap, it was revealed that there were a few couples who made it out of the show together! Emily Miller and Cam Holmes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">announced they were still together</a>, while Carly Lawrence and Joey Joy also revealed they are dating, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well, Peter and Melinda hopped onto the bandwagon, sharing with fans that they too are dating! Luckily for the duo, it appears as if Marvin Anthony isn't all that upset over Melinda dating Peter.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Exclusive: Why Cam Unfollowed Chase After 'Too Hot To Handle' Wrapped Up</a></span></p><p>The couple has posted a few steamy shots together on Instagram, sparking fans and their former Too Hot To Handle to comment all kinds of supportive messages under their pics.</p><p>Well, one of those comments was from none other than Marvin! The Parisi heartthrob not only commented under Peter's photo, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he also commented under Melinda's!</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Congrats" followed by the champagne emoji is what he wrote under Melinda's post. Considering Marvin lost out on the chance to really date Melinda in the outside world, we're certain that the congratulatory message was slightly salted.</p><p>As for his comment under Peter's pic, Marvin wrote, "Good job buddy!" Although this may seem like he's totally on board, "buddy" is often used to speak down to someone or in reference to a kid, leaving fans to wonder whether Marvin was actually alright with it or not.</p><p>Since Marvin is tucked away in Paris with his $55,000 and newly found fame, we're certain he isn't at all bothered by Peter and Melinda dating!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>'Too Hot To Handle': 10 Things Fans Forgot About Harry And Francesca</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKddnby1edOoZKGZnpm5pnnWoZitZZSksrR5zJqpr6GeYq6vwMeopbJlpJ22r7eMqJ1mpZWhtq%2BwwGaYp5xdpbK1sdGsZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
