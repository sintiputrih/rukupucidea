With a total of 278 chapters compiled into 31 volumes, Tokyo Revengers is divided into seven arcs, with the last one broken down into two parts.</p><ul data-current-count=697.5 data-injectable=true><li>Toman arc — Manga chapters 1-12; Anime episodes 1-5</li><li>Moebius arc — Manga chapters 13-33; Anime episodes 6-12</li><li>Valhalla arc — Manga chapters 34-77; Anime episodes 13-25</li><li>Black Dragon arc — Manga chapters 78-121; Anime episodes 26-37</li><li>Tenjiku arc — Manga chapters 122-185; Anime episodes 37-present</li><li>Bonten arc — Manga chapters 186-206</li><li>Final arc — Manga chapters 207-278<ul><li>Three Deities arc — Manga chapters 207-235</li><li>Kanto Manji arc — Manga chapters 236-278</li></ul></li></ul><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>This seems like too few arcs compared to some other big Shonen hits, doesn’t it?
