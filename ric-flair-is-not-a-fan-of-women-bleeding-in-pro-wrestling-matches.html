Anna Jay suffered a huge bump during that match, <a href=#>which made fans worry about her well-being.</a></p><p>Thankfully, Anna Jay is doing okay after that scary bump. The match will likely be remembered for the incredible level of violence on display throughout its duration. This included Ruby Soho donning a crimson mask, as the visual continues to be shared even now.</p><p>The concept of female professional wrestlers bleeding is not a new one, as it has been a thing for several years now. While speaking on his <a href=#>To Be The Man</a> podcast, Ric Flair made it clear that he believes women should not bleed as much as men in pro wrestling.</p><p>I don’t like it. I mean, I guess everybody’s got their own opinion, but I certainly wouldn’t want to see Charlotte bleeding.</p><p>I &nbsp;think there should be more with the guys. No matter how you look at it, how do you put two people in a cage match? Ten years ago, every time we hit the cage, we’re bleeding. Now nothing happens. That’s one thing I don’t like. I don’t like the girls in a cage match for sure because I think it limits their ability, their athleticism, and their ability to do athletic things like off-the-top rope and that.”</p><p>One would argue that it is certainly ironic Ric Flair is saying all this, considering the fact that he has bled very often throughout his matches – including his final match last year. Regardless, it is unlikely he will warm up to bloody matches featuring women anytime soon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
