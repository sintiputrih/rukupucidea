But it is a sacrifice to be made.”</p><p>She added: “If you not really ready for that, I would say just go do something else.

Maybe the most consistent interaction with somebody that I’ve ever had, ’cause we’ve talked every day for the past year and a half. So I mean, it’s pretty consistent.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0minqKeYYsCptcSsq7JlqaTCr7OMrZ%2Bun12irrO1wKFkrJuZmru1tdKtZJ2ho6g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
