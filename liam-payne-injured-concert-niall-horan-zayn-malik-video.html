While performing with One Direction in Portugal last night (June 13), Liam Payne accidentally tripped and hurt his knee, leaving the singer in pain but determined to continue the show.

As the band's guitarist played the opening notes to the romantic ballad, Niall and Zayn emerged onstage, carrying and supporting Liam, who had each of his arms wrapped around his bandmates' shoulders."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Sigh!</p><p>As the band's guitarist played the opening notes to the romantic ballad, Niall and Zayn emerged onstage, carrying and supporting Liam, who had each of his arms wrapped around his bandmates' shoulders. So sweet! The guys carefully carried Liam down a ramp and onto a lower section of the stage, as the audience erupted into screams and chants of "Liam! Liam!" before the guys began the heart-melting tune.</p><p>Of course, it comes as no surprise that the Directioners in the audience immediately went into a frenzy. Not only are One Direction swoon-worthy to begin with, there is absolutely nothing sweeter than the way the guys quite literally support each other like they do. And the same goes for the fans as well, who quickly got #GetWellLiamWeLoveYou to become a trending topic on Twitter.</p><p>Watch Niall and Zayn carry Liam onto the stage in the sweet video above!</p><p><strong>Check Out Harry Styles + More Shirtless Celeb Hotties</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6Wws8HSoWWcp51kuaqtzGanmrGemnqqusmuqZ6cXZi8r6%2FEq6tmppmWua15x6ipmqZdr666uoymmKWhm2LDqrDEqGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
