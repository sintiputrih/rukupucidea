Recommended Videos McGregor took to Instagram at the turn of the new year to announce he’d meet Chandler in a 185-pound clash on June 29 during the UFC’s annual International Fight Week. The promotion has yet to confirm the meeting. But, considering the two have been linked since filming The Ultimate Fighter last year, and the Irishman has seemingly been champing at the bit to return, it’s likely that the contest will take place as “Notorious” said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And the man standing in his way is another electric striker with a do-or-die attitude.</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true>Since signing with the UFC in 2020, the former Bellator lightweight champion has wracked up two high-profile victories over Tony Ferguson and Dan Hooker while notching several post-fight bonuses. Although three losses have kept him from securing gold in the UFC, Chandler is touted as one of the most exciting athletes in the sport and one of the most decorated.</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>In a professional mixed martial arts record that dates back to 2009, the 37-year-old father and husband has put together a 23-9 record with 11 wins via KO/TKO, seven by submission, and five via decision. Iron was one of the faces of Bellator for years, and he had a fruitful career with the organization which saw him earn the 155-pound strap on three separate occasions.</p><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=854 data-injectable=true>Chandler’s background as a NCAA Division 1 wrestler helped propel him to the top of the lightweight charts. But it’s been his fearless striking and raw power that’s made him one of the biggest stars in the sport. His knockout over Ferguson at UFC 274 in May 2022 stood as one of the most brutal triumphs of the year, and his back-and-forth tilt with Justin Gaethje in November 2021 at UFC 268 earned many publications’ “Fight of the Year” honors.</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>Iron’s two-fight series with former UFC and Bellator lightweight king Eddie Alvarez is revered by hardcore fans, and even in his losses, like when he failed to capture the UFC’s vacant 155-pound crown in May 2021 by falling to Charles Oliveira, Chandler is a man known for putting on incredibly violent entertainment.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=false>Both Chandler and McGregor are known for their aggressive nature, especially in the opening round. So, expect nothing short of fireworks if their contest goes down in June — it’s a fight destined to end before the final buzzer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpbyzwNJorqGnXZ7AbrnInJ%2BanZxisKmtzZ2jnqpdmLyvu9FmpJyfopq0sL7SZqWesKRivLG8zqecp6xdmsWxuMCipZ6cXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
