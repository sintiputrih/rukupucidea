According to <a href=#>ComicBook</a>, the two stars have been entertaining the idea of starring in a fourth film together, but they’re waiting for the right story to tell. To date, Sandler and Barrymore have co-starred in three <a href=#>romantic comedy</a> films (The Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates, and Blended), and they truly enjoy their friendship, and working alongside one another.</p><p>As for what the <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=upcoming data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>upcoming</a> project could potentially be about, your guess is as good as ours. The conversation came about at the Mark Twain Awards, which <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="Adam Sandler" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Adam Sandler</a> was a recipient, and Drew Barrymore weighed in on how the two are actively seeking their next collaboration. Though the three films they starred in up to this point have been romantic comedies, Barrymore went on record stating that she’d like to do something different than what they’ve done in the past.</p><p>Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore first graced us with their presence in 1998’s The Wedding Singer, which was a wildly successful story about… you guessed it, a wedding singer who was left at the alter by his fiancé, and ultimately falls in love with one of his clients who has a troubled engagement of her own.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/adam-sandler-drew-barrymore-blended-africa-900x506.jpg><p>This creative partnership was followed up with 2004’s 50 First Dates which found Sandler trying to win over Barrymore once again. But this time she suffered from short-term memory loss, and he had to be persistent in his approach to win her over by repeatedly taking her out on first dates.</p><p>2014 brought us Blended, which was yet another romantic comedy that starts with a blind date between two single parents before going wrong. But through circumstances beyond their control, they are forced to get to know each other when they run into each other at an African safari resort. Each of these films stand well on their own despite similarities in story structure. But the future may bring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore a different kind of story to tell in their next collaboration.</p><p>While elaborating on her future collaboration with Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore stated that they want to try something new this time around, but they also don’t to reinvent the wheel just for the sake of doing something different. As for the story they want to tell, The Charlie’s Angels star stated “Adam and I seem to really know it when we know it. And we’re like ‘This is it.'”</p><p>As of now, however, we don’t know what kind of film Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore will put out, as they are just in the talking phases. After all, both stars have a pretty extensive range; we’ve seen Sandler flex his dramatic muscle in films like Uncut Gems, and Barrymore has also explored darker roles like her supporting role in Donnie Darko (alongside <a href=#>Jake Gyllenhaal</a>).</p><p>Though we’re speculating about what different direction they will take their new film in, we’re also on board for another romantic comedy if that’s what they ultimately choose to do.</p><p>Adam Sandler’s Spaceman in Bohemia is slated for a late 2023 Netflix Release, and Drew Barrymore is currently hard at work with her syndicated <a href=#>talk show</a>, The Drew Barrymore Show. We know all too well how scheduling issues are always an obstacle to overcome in Hollywood, but let’s hope that Sandler and Barrymore have some openings in their calendars to get to work on this fourth collaboration that’s currently in the talking phase.</p><p>Whether it’s another romantic comedy, or a <a href=#>science fiction</a> psychological drama, we know they’ll be able to do what they do best together, and put out an amazing film.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iZlJa6br%2FAp5ulnaJisbOx1maZmqqirrqwvsRmnaKknWO1tbnL</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
