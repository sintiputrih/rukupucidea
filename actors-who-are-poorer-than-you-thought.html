Still, he's worked as a well-known actor for decades, so you might imagine he'd be worth a bit more than the $500,000 <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a> estimates. That is, until you factor in the fact that Baldwin got into a lot of tax and credit card trouble a few years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>After falling behind on his mortgage payments on his million-dollar Long Island home, Baldwin tried to sell, and, according to <a href=#>The Blast</a>, wound up defaulting on the $781,000 loan instead. At the same time, the IRS came after him for basically not paying taxes for a couple of years, slapping a $407,000 lien on the actor.&nbsp;</p><p>Baldwin has spent the last few years cleaning up his finances. The house was auctioned off, and Baldwin and his wife moved into a "small apartment in Queens" to reduce expenses. Baldwin got the lien lifted a few years ago, but all that drama has had a negative effect on his net worth. All the same, the actor has four projects listed on <a href=#>IMDB</a> this year, so he might be on his way to being a millionaire again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Bj3FncGpflrC1u9GsZLCgn2Kus7GMqaaoqpWnerW0wKdksqelYsGpu9Sgn61n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
