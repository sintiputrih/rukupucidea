He has claimed to have two middle names, neither of which is Arthur despite what some sources might say.

Source: Instagram</p><h4><span>History</span></h4><p>He started the server in April after begging Carson on an episode of Soothouse. Therefore, he was quickly offered to squat in BeefStew’s melon castle while Beef was away studying. Despite never having streamed before he quickly befriended many people on the server and found himself at home amongst them. He built a series of tall structures on an island East of the Melon Castle.</p><p>He called it his “Dirty Crime Hub” and quickly set to work in a series of pranks on members of the server specifically AntVenom, CaptainSparklez, Jschlatt, ConnorEatsPants, CallMeCarson, and JimmyHere. Since he was close to Jschlatt, he quickly became involved in the Schlattcoin venture and was used as a proxy for Schlatt and Connor to commit crimes on the server, culminating with him stealing 90 diamonds from the spawn police station.</p><p>Schlatt then moved on to help him take out targets on the server including Junky Janker which backfired resulting in a lawsuit between him and Schlatt. He was found guilty and sentenced to death via spleef. He moved house in June 2019 so he was not present on the server for a few months.</p><p>Upon return, though his time on SMPLive was brought to another temporary halt after a backfired prank on AntVenom caused him to take some time off. The work he created at this time resulted in his YouTube channel blowing up and started the genre of Minecraft content revolving around the title “Minecraft but…”.</p><h4><span>More about his career</span></h4><p>Mainly he used to produce a video with Jschlatt but due to unknown circumstances, he now does them on his own. He was then invited to RTGameCrowd onto the server. RT went on to build a house on his island and the two have lived together since.</p><p>He joined the server again briefly to partake in The SMPLive Talent Show which he won with a performance of the song he wrote when he was 14, “The Squid Song”. Moreover, he returned to SMPLive to create Whalebur Soot the whale fact-sharing whale in the nether hub. The whale produced completely false facts and became a staple on the server pleasing customers such as Pokimane and Ted Nivison.</p><p>He has stated that he feels season one has run its course and he’s eagerly awaiting season two to reignite his passion for the SMPLive server. When he was younger he had few friends so watched the top 100 rated IMDB films. However, he has never seen films about Avengers. (according to the video “I finally escaped Europe”).</p><p>Moreover, he was involved in the first SootHouse video titled “Bulgarian Real Estate”. It showed him and Soot George mocking websites selling cheap houses in Eastern Europe. It was posted in April 2017.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-68258 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Wilbur-Soot-youtuber.jpg alt="Wilbur Soot" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-68258 class=wp-caption-text>Wilbur Soot clicking a photo with his Golden YouTube Play Button.
