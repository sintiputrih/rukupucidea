Real Madrid Castilla competes in the 3rd tier of the Spanish soccer league system and is the reserve team of Real Madrid CF. With Real Madrid CF, Vinícius won both the La Liga (the top tier of the Spanish soccer league system) title and the&nbsp;Supercopa de España in the 2019-20 and 2021-22 seasons. The 2021-22 La Liga&nbsp;title was the club’s record-extending 35th such. Vinícius was also included in the ‘La Liga Team of the Season’ for his performances in that season. Real Madrid CF‘s Supercopa de España title in the 2021-22 season was its 12th such, extending its stature as the 2nd-most successful team in the competition. The Supercopa de España (founded in 1982 as a 2-team competition) has been contested since the 2019-20 season by 4 teams – the winners and runners-up of La Liga and the Copa del Rey (the premier domestic knockout soccer competition in Spain). At the international level, Vinícius represented Brazil at the under-15, under-17, and under-20 tiers before making his senior national debut in September 2019.</p><h3>Born Name</h3><p>Vinícius José Paixão de Oliveira Júnior</p><h3>Nick Name</h3><p>Vinícius Júnior, Vini Jr.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Vinicius-Junior-as-seen-in-an-Instagram-Post-in-March-2022.jpg><h3>Sun Sign</h3><p>Cancer</p><h3>Born Place</h3><p>São Gonçalo, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</p><h3>Residence</h3><p>Madrid, Spain</p><h3>Nationality</h3><p><img decoding=async title=Brazilian src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Brazil.png alt=Brazilian width=64 height=46 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img decoding=async title=Spanish src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Spain.png alt=Spanish width=62 height=42 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He holds dual nationality.</p><h3>Occupation</h3><p>Professional Soccer Player</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Brazil.png><h3>Family</h3><ul><li><strong>Father</strong> – Vinícius José Paixão de Oliveira</li><li><strong>Mother&nbsp;</strong>– Tatiana Vinícius</li><li><strong>Siblings</strong> – Alessandra Oliveira (Sister), Carlos Vinícius (Older Brother) (Soccer Player), Netinho Vinícius (Younger Brother)</li><li><strong>Others&nbsp;</strong>– Ulisses (Uncle)</li></ul><h3>Shirt Number</h3><ul><li>21, 20, 18, 7 – Brazil</li><li>20 – CR Flamengo</li><li>28, 25, 20 – Real Madrid CF</li><li>11 – Real Madrid Castilla</li></ul><h3>Playing Position</h3><p>Winger</p><h3>Build</h3><p>Athletic</p><h3>Height</h3><p>5 ft 9 in or 175 cm</p><h3>Weight</h3><p>73 kg or 161 lbs</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Spain.png><h3>Girlfriend / Spouse</h3><p>Vinícius has dated –</p><li><strong>Maria Júlia Mazalli </strong>(2019-Present)</li><h3>Race / Ethnicity</h3><p>Black</p><h3>Hair Color</h3><p>Black</p><h3>Eye Color</h3><p>Dark Brown</p><h3>Sexual Orientation</h3><p>Straight</p><h3>Distinctive Features</h3><ul><li>Toned physique</li><li>Side-cropped, afro hair</li><li>Affable smile</li><li>Clean-shaven look</li><li>Has his left hand covered in tattoos</li></ul><h3>Religion</h3><p>Roman Catholicism</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Vinicius-Junior-as-seen-in-an-Instagram-Post-in-December-2022.jpg><h3>Vinícius Júnior Facts</h3><li>His youth career began in 2005 when, as a 5-year-old, he joined the youth system of CR Flamengo, one of Brazil’s most successful sports clubs in the 20th century. Hailing from a poor family, Vinícius had to live with his uncle, Ulisses, so that he could save money on commuting to the training ground and youth team headquarters of the club.</li><li>During his time with the club’s youth system, he used to receive financial aid from local entrepreneurs as well as the club’s owners. Vinícius was promoted to the club’s senior professional team in 2017.</li><li>With Brazil, he won the 2015 edition of the South American Under-15 Championship. It was the country’s record-extending 4th such title. Vinícius was the 2nd-highest goalscorer in the tournament with 6 goals to his name, including 2 goals in Brazil’s 3-1 win over Ecuador in the semi-final.</li><li>In 2016, he was the top goalscorer (4 goals) in Brazils’ triumphant campaign in the inaugural edition of the BRICS Under-17 Football Cup. BRICS is an acronym for 5 of the leading emerging economies of the world – Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</li><li>In 2017, Vinícius was named the ‘Best Left-Winger’ in recognition of his performances in the Copa São Paulo de Futebol Júnior, the most important youth soccer tournament in Brazil.</li><li>With Brazil, he also won the 2017 edition of the South American Under-17 Championship. It was the country’s record-extending 12th such title. Vinícius was the highest goalscorer in the tournament with 7 goals to his name.</li><li>He was also named the ‘Player of the Tournament’. The win secured Brazil’s place in the 2017 edition of the FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) Under-17 World Cup where the team finished in 3rd place but Vinícius was not part of that Brazilian squad.</li><li>In May 2017, Spanish giants Real Madrid CF signed a contract to acquire him from CR Flamengo. The deal, though, was to come into effect only after July 12, 2018 (his 18th birthday) because 18 was the minimum age for an international transfer at that time.</li><li>The eventual transfer, for a reported fee of €46 million (£38 million), was the then 2nd-most expensive sale of a player in the history of Brazilian soccer (only behind <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Neymar</a>), the largest transfer fee received by a Brazilian club at that time, and the then highest amount paid by a club for a soccer player under the age of 19.</li><li>Vinícius was a part of the Real Madrid CF squad that won the FIFA Club World Cup title in 2018. The tournament involves 7 teams – the continental club champions of Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Oceania, and Europe; and the host nation’s national champions – in a straight knock-out tournament. The 2018 title was the club’s 4th such and made it the then-most successful team in the competition.</li><li>With Brazil, he finished as the runner-up in the 2021 edition of the Copa América, the premier men’s soccer tournament contested between national teams from South America. Played for the first time in 1916, it is the oldest continental soccer competition that is still active.</li><li>With Real Madrid CF, Vinícius won the UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) Champions League (the most prestigious club competition in European soccer) title in the 2021-22 season; and the UEFA Super Cup in 2022. The 2021-22 UEFA Champions League&nbsp;title was the club’s record-extending 14th such.</li><li>He scored the only goal in the final of the tournament. For his performances, he was included in the ‘UEFA Champions League Team of the Season’ and was also named the ‘UEFA Champions League Young Player of the Season’.</li><li>The UEFA&nbsp;Super Cup (founded in 1972) is annually decided via a one-off match played between the winners of the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League (the 2nd-tier club competition in European soccer, ranking below the UEFA Champions League). Real Madrid CF‘s 2022 UEFA Super Cup&nbsp;triumph was the club’s 5th such trophy and tied it with FC Barcelona and A.C. Milan as the then-most successful clubs in the competition’s history.</li><li>Vinícius finished the 2021-22 season as Real Madrid CF’s 2nd-highest goalscorer (22 goals) across all competitions, only behind <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Karim Benzema</a>.</li><li>In September 2022, in addition to his Brazilian nationality, he acquired Spanish citizenship.</li><li>In Brazil’s opening group-stage match of the 2022 edition of the FIFA World Cup, against Serbia, Vinícius set up the 2nd goal of Brazil’s 2-0 victory. After the end of the tournament, this 2nd goal against Serbia, scored by <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Richarlison</a>, was chosen by fans as the ‘Goal of the Tournament’ (from among a shortlist of 10 goals) via a poll conducted on/by FIFA.com.</li><li>In the pre-quarterfinal stage of the tournament, a 4-1 win against South Korea, he scored Brazil’s 1st goal and assisted the last. The goal that Vinícius scored was just the 2nd of his senior-level international career for Brazil. Croatia then defeated Brazil in the quarter-final which meant that this was the 4th time in the last 5 editions of the tournament that the 5-time champions had been knocked out in the quarter-final stage.</li><p>Featured Image by Vinícius Júnior / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jq%2Bgp6GTnsK0ecmupaKnomQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
