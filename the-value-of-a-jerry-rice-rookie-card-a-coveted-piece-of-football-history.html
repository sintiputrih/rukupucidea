Its limited availability contributes to its high demand and subsequent market value.</p><p>Importance of Condition and Grading: The condition and grading of a Jerry Rice rookie card significantly impact its value. Collectors and investors seek cards in excellent condition, as any imperfections or damage can greatly diminish their worth.
