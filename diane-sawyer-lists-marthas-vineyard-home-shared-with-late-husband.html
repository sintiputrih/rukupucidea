We have always felt so lucky to be together in this magic place.”</p><p>The estate is listed at $24 million.</p><p>Sawyer’s husband died in 2014 after suffering a heart attack at their Manhattan apartment.

He remembered the path winding out over the dune to the beach, like an invitation to a perfect day. It always kept its hold on his imagination.”</p><p>Situated on 20 sprawling acres, the beach compound was built for legendary actress Cornell in the 1940s. Cornell would entertain luminaries such as Noel Coward, Eleanor Roosevelt and Laurence Olivier.</p><p>Sawyer and Nichols restored the home throughout the years using it as a place for large gatherings to host family and friends.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The pool boasts ocean views and dressing rooms. <span class=credit>Bob Gothard/ Wallace and Co.
