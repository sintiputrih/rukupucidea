We apologize greatly to inform you of this news. For the previous 27 years, FF Powers has been a member of the FDNY. Dan’s world consisted of Danny, now seventeen, and Callie, now twenty.</p><p>Dan was a resident of Suffern, married to Christine Powers, the woman he had loved his entire life, and the two of them had two lovely children. Christine was sadly lost to Dan, Callie, and Danny on October 25, 2022—exactly one year ago. Dan is proud of his accomplishments in his career, but his greatest accomplishment, in his opinion, is his family.</p><p>Dan’s universe revolved on Callie, who is now twenty years old, and Danny, who is currently seventeen. Dan had been in love with Christine Powers his entire life. The two of them were married and had two beautiful children. Christine was sadly lost to Dan, Callie, and Danny on October 25, 2022—exactly one year ago. The sudden death of Dan has thrown Callie and Danny into adulthood and put them in a situation that no child should ever have to experience.<br>Because of Dan, Callie and Danny are now in a situation that no child should ever have to face. There should never be a need for a child to experience this situation. In addition to all of the other obligations that come with being an adult, they now have car and home payments to make.
