On June 3, 1995, in London, England, the lovely model was born to an English mother and an Iranian father. She grew raised in Sale, Greater Manchester, with her parents and spent most of her youth there. Aside from her parents’ identities, nothing is known about their professional lives.</p><p>The actress is the family’s oldest child, with two younger brothers, Milan and Gabe. However, since Maddison is a private person, just the names of her brothers have been released.&nbsp;She attended Sir John Deane’s College for sixth form.
