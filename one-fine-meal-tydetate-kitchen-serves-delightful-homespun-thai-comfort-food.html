When the family got the opportunity to be a part of Chattahoochee Food Works, it made good economic sense, said co-owner Matt Bhamaraniyama, 29, who has worked in restaurants since he was about 15. He has done everything from bussing tables to serving to bartending — working at <a href=#>Tuk Tuk Thai Food Loft, Nan Thai Fine Dining and Chai Yo Modern Thai</a>, where he was the opening manager.</p><p class=story-text data-index=11>“We thought it was time for us to do something for ourselves,” he said. (Pak Raparpesh is the fourth partner-cousin, and the kitchen manager of TydeTate.)</p><p class=story-text data-index=13>I got a tip about TydeTate just as it was transitioning from a shared kitchen to its new space in a bustling corner of Chattahoochee Food Works, right next to a capacious patio and the food hall’s central bar. It seemed only fair to give it time to find its sea legs.</p><span class=prefix>Explore</span><a class=headline href=#>Intown Atlanta dining news</a><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Wendell Brock</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ajc.com/things-to-do/atlanta-restaurant-blog/one-fine-meal-tydetate-kitchen-serves-delightful-homespun-thai-comfort-food/QINFDEM3YBEXZOYSEMATOYNAAM/%5Bobject%20Object%5D alt="icon to expand image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Wendell Brock</p><p class=story-text data-index=16>On Memorial Day, I stopped by and ordered a feast: spring rolls, saku dumplings, pad Thai, chicken fried rice and Thai beef salad. Then, I retired to the patio to taste each dish, one by one.</p><p class=story-text data-index=17>I was blown away by the stellar cooking, beautiful presentation (in takeout boxes, no less) and the quality and freshness of the ingredients. Who would have thought that one of the city’s better Thai kitchens would be lurking quietly in the corner of a food hall? Not I.</p><p class=story-text data-index=18>At any Thai restaurant, the litmus test for me is the pad Thai and the spring rolls. TydeTate gets high marks for both — delightfully crispy rolls, filled with cabbage, carrots and glass noodles, and a perfectly balanced pad Thai, with noodles that impart just the right texture (not too limp!), and a sauce that packs just the right amount of sweetness and tang. I had no trouble emptying that box.</p><span class=prefix>Explore</span><a class=headline href=#>Best Atlanta takeout</a><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Wendell Brock</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ajc.com/things-to-do/atlanta-restaurant-blog/one-fine-meal-tydetate-kitchen-serves-delightful-homespun-thai-comfort-food/QINFDEM3YBEXZOYSEMATOYNAAM/%5Bobject%20Object%5D alt="icon to expand image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Wendell Brock</p><p class=story-text data-index=23>The saku bites — the restaurant’s take on classic saku sai moo dumplings — were stunning. Thanks to the addition of butterfly pea flowers to rice flour, the dumpling skins were transformed to a magical shade of purple. Stuffed with caramelized palm sugar, crushed peanuts, minced chicken and pickled radish — and served with tender romaine leaves for wrapping, cilantro for garnishing and tongue-torching whole red chiles for piercing the sweetness — they are delicate, with just a hint of danger. (In other words, go easy on the red-hot peppers.)</p><p class=story-text data-index=24>The beef salad — grilled flank steak, yellow pearl-drop tomatoes, red onion, scallions, aromatic herbs and spicy chile-lime sauce over romaine — was another knockout. My one quibble here was that the chicken fried rice, though nicely executed, was just a tad bland. However, by the time I revisited it, as leftovers for supper, the flavors had mingled. All it needed was a muscular shot or two of hot sauce.</p><p class=story-text data-index=25>Watching the family work together in their tight space, my mind drifted back to the streets of Bangkok, where magnificent flavors are born from modest circumstances. In every sense, TydeTate captures the essence of honest, heartfelt Thai cuisine. I already yearn to return.</p><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Wendell Brock</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ajc.com/things-to-do/atlanta-restaurant-blog/one-fine-meal-tydetate-kitchen-serves-delightful-homespun-thai-comfort-food/QINFDEM3YBEXZOYSEMATOYNAAM/%5Bobject%20Object%5D alt="icon to expand image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Wendell Brock</p><p class=story-text data-index=28><b>TYDETATE KITCHEN</b></p><p class=story-text data-index=29><b>Menu: </b>Thai comfort food</p><p class=story-text data-index=30><b>Alcohol: </b>no, but there are numerous options from neighboring food-hall vendors and a central bar</p><p class=story-text data-index=31><b>What I ordered: </b>spring rolls, saku bites, chicken fried rice, Thai beef salad, pad Thai.
