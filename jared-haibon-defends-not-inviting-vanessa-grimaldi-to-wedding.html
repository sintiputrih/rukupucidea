“Vanessa and I talked about it.

The special education teacher later admitted that she was “sad” about the decision, which she thought was made because her ex-fiancé, <a href=#><strong>Nick Viall</strong></a>, will <a href=#>serve as a groomsman in the ceremony</a>.</p><p>“I totally get it … I understand and … I don’t want to make an ass of myself by making an assumption, but I assume it’s because of a particular person,” she told Haibon and cohost <a href=#><strong>Dean Unglert</strong></a>. “I get that, and like I said, I’m not mad, I’m not anything, I’m mostly just sad.”</p><p>However, Viall <a href=#>shut down his ex’s claim that he is the reason</a> why she did not get an invite to the upcoming event. “Ashley and Jared’s wedding is Ashley and Jared days,” he commented via Instagram in April. “Looking forward to enjoying the day with them and everyone they want to celebrate it with.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Iaconetti, 31, and Haibon met during season 2 of <a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a> and were friends for several years before they <a href=#>officially started dating in March 2018</a>.
