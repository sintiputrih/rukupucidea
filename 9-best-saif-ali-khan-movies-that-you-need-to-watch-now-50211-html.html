Omkara (2006)</strong></h2><br><p>Omkara was a gutsy move by filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj who got on board an ensemble cast for this Indian adaptation of William Shakespeare's Othello. The film featured Saif Ali Khan, Ajay Devgn, <strong><a href=# title="Kareena Kapoor Khan’s 20 hottest dance numbers">Kareena Kapoor</a></strong>, Konkona Sen Sharma, Vivek Oberoi, and Bipasha Basu playing the lead roles to perfection. Saif Ali Khan had played the role of Langda Tyagi in the film. Saif played the role of an antagonist rather convincingly in the film and to date, it is one of the most menacing roles he has played onscreen. The story revolves around how , driven by ego and jealousy, he manages to manipulate Ajay Devgn’s character, forcing him to suspect his wife of adultery. No one survives the bloodbath which ensues in the end, leading to tragic consequences all around.</p><br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2022/jun/9bestsaifalikhanmoviesthatyouneedtowatchnow11654674289.jpg alt="9 Best Saif Ali Khan Movies That You Need To Watch Now!" width=616 height=924 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><h2><strong>8. Parineeta (2005)</strong></h2><br><p>Saif Ali Khan looked as handsome as ever as he donned the role of Shekhar Roy in Parineeta which also marked <strong><a href=# title="Filmfare recommends: Debut hits of top heroines down the years">Vidya Balan's debut</a></strong> in Bollywood. The film also featured Sanjay Dutt and Raima Sen in parallel roles who contributed to the storyline. Saif Ali Khan (Shekhar Roy) bonds with Lalita (Vidya Balan), his childhood neighbour. That friendship blossoms into unsaid feelings that are deeply felt by both of them. Saif Ali Khan plays his role of a self-absorbed and controlling man with conviction. Shekhar is so used to Lalita taking care of all his needs that he grows more dependent on her than his parents. The film won five Filmfare Awards, but Parineeta had also bagged the National Award for Best Debut Film Of A Director, which went to Pradeep Sarkar.</p><br><br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2022/jun/9-best-saif-ali-khan-movies-that-you-need-to-watch-now-21654687120.jpg alt="9 Best Saif Ali Khan Movies That You Need To Watch Now!" width=616 height=924 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2><strong>9. Tanhaji : The Unsung Warrior (2020)</strong></h2><br><p>If there's any proof needed on how well <strong><a href=# title="Photos: Ajay Devgn and Saif Ali Khan launch the trailer of Tanhaji: The Unsung Hero">Saif Ali Khan</a></strong> can play a negative character, this film was proof! A magnum opus with a veteran like Ajay Devgn leading the show, Saif Ali Khan sure impressed audiences with his role as Udaybhan Rathod. Some might say that he has played a grey character like this earlier too, however this time it was a historical character that he was playing. Udaybhan Rathod was an arch-enemy of <strong><a href=# title="Tanhaji : The Unsung Warrior crosses the 100 crore mark at the box-office">Tanhaji</a></strong> Malusare (played by Ajay Devgn) who was a Maratha Subedar. Saif was so convincing in his portrayal of the role that he had been compared to Ranveer Singh's role as Alauddin Khilji in Padmaavat. Saif had also undergone training in horse-riding and rigorous physical training to do justice to his role in this action film.</p><br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/filmfare.wwmindia.com/content/2022/jun/9bestsaifalikhanmoviesthatyouneedtowatchnow31654674306.jpg alt="9 Best Saif Ali Khan Movies That You Need To Watch Now!" width=616 height=821 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><p>Saif Ali Khan's filmography is replete with versatile roles. From playing the happy-go-lucky guy to playing historical roles. Grey characters or an out-and-out comedy role - Saif Ali Khan has always gone for some of the most diverse characters and has left the audience impressed every time.</p><br><strong>Read More - <a href=# title="Here's A Round Up Of Sara Ali Khan's Movies">Here's A Round Up Of Sara Ali Khan's Movies</a></strong> More on: <a href=#><span>saif ali khan</span></a>, <a href=#><span>saif ali khan movies you need to watch</span></a>, <a href=#><span>saif ali khan movies</span></a>, <a href=#><span>love aaj kal</span></a>, <a href=#><span>dil chahta hai</span></a>, <a href=#><span>cocktail</span></a>, <a href=#><span>hum tum</span></a>, <a href=#><span>jawaani jaaneman</span></a>, <a href=#><span>go goa gone</span></a>, <a href=#><span>Omkara</span></a>, <a href=#><span>Parineeta</span></a>, <a href=#><span>Tanhaji The Unsung Warrior</span></a>, <a href=#><span>tanhaji</span></a>, <a href=#><span>bollywood movies</span></a>, <a href=#><span>bollywood films</span></a>, <a href=#><span>entertainment news</span></a>, <a href=#><span>trending news</span></a>, <a href=#><span>saif ali khan news</span></a>, <a href=#><span>news</span></a>, <a href=#><span>bollywood news</span></a>, <a href=#><span>news</span></a> <a style=text-decoration:none class="row drops" onclick='showCommentBox("1",50211)' href=#><h2 class="commentsCount clearfix"><span>SHOW COMMENTS</span></h2><span id=commentCount50211 class="expand-i pull-right"></span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XLpp2aqpVjsLC5jp%2Bcmqylp7K0e5hmmZ6rpGLAorXFZpiloV2gtaK6jKamr6GVqHq1tMCtZLKnpWK7prHDZquoZaeWwaS0jKemsGVlZX9yfY2hq6ak</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
