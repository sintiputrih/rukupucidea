The song’s lyrics depict a group of individuals who are trapped within the confines of Alcatraz, a notorious prison known for its impenetrable walls and harrowing conditions.</p><p>The hook of the song, sung by Iniquity, introduces the concept of being confined to a prison of doom, but not giving in to submission. The group of prisoners has devised a plot to escape Alcatraz and they are prepared to give it their all. This sets the tone for the rest of the song, as it embodies the determination and resilience of the characters in their quest for freedom.</p><p>The first verse, performed by Iniquity, emphasizes the frustration and longing for freedom that has built up over the years spent in prison. The narrator refuses to let their fears or any obstacles prevent them from achieving their goal. The reference to Die Rise, a zombie map from the game Call of Duty: Black Ops II, adds a layer of intensity and chaos to their journey, as they are willing to face any challenge to escape.</p><p>Nappy’s verse brings in a sense of regret and reflection on the circumstances that led them to Alcatraz. The mention of being “Left 4 Dead” could imply that they were in the wrong place at the wrong time, and they acknowledge that their actions have consequences. Despite this, they continue to fight against the zombie hordes that stand in their way, acknowledging the importance of their acquired strength through the Juggernog perk in the game.</p><p>The chorus repeats, highlighting the group’s determination and confidence in their plan. They are not afraid to use any means necessary to execute their final blast and escape Alcatraz.</p><p>In the second verse, Nappy takes charge and claims the generator in the Warden’s office as a crucial part of their escape plan. The realization that he is his only savior adds a sense of responsibility and self-reliance. As he navigates through the prison, Nappy uses a tomahawk to fend off oncoming zombies and redeem himself from the hellish existence they are trapped in.</p><p>Iniquity’s verse brings forth a sense of empowerment and awe-inspiring weaponry. The mention of dropping nukes, using a Tommy Gun, and the Acid Gat highlights their determination to annihilate the undead and leave their mark on Alcatraz. The references to Electric Cherry and Gondola add a nostalgic touch for fans of the game, while also heightening the intensity of their escape.</p><p>The final verse, performed by Nappy, focuses on the group’s resilience as they approach the golden gates of hell. They acknowledge that they have come too far to let their mission fail. The Never Forgotten warriors, a reference to fallen soldiers, are welcomed home as they impale the zombies and fight against the undead horde. The song concludes with a note of triumph and remembrance, as Nappy and Iniquity’s names are etched in gamer history.</p><p>Escape From Alcatraz by Iniquity Rhymes resonates with me on a personal level. As a fan of the Call of Duty: Zombies game mode, the song captures the essence of the intense and thrilling battles against the undead. The lyrics, combined with the energetic beats and delivery, create a sense of urgency and determination that fuels the player’s desire to survive and escape their virtual prison.</p><p>Furthermore, the overarching theme of breaking free from confinement can be applied to various aspects of life. We all have our own personal prisons or challenges that we face, and Escape From Alcatraz serves as a reminder to never give up and to keep pushing forward despite the odds stacked against us.</p><p>Overall, Escape From Alcatraz by Iniquity Rhymes is an empowering and adrenaline-pumping song that explores the universal desire for freedom and the resilience of the human spirit. Its references to the Call of Duty: Zombies game mode further enhance its appeal to fans of the franchise. This song serves as a reminder to always fight for what we believe in and to never let our circumstances define us.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminnJnBqrnEpqysoZNjsLC5jrBqaKyYmnquscCnoKefXZeyqbXNnWStoJViwLC6xmacrJuRpbJustGopGaZnJiutb7As2SbsV2eu6q91KKrsmWincausdJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
