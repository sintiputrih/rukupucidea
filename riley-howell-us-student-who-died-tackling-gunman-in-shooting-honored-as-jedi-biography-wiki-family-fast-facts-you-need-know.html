Because, you know, they could have just said Ri-Lee – Jedi Ri-Lee – and we’d be guessing the whole time about whether or not that was really [him], but they put his last name in there just to really honor him … and that really made me cry when I heard about it.”</p><p>The family went to see the new movie on opening night. They brought his ashes and left a seat open for him.</p><p>“I think he would have liked the way it ended,” Henry-Howell said.</p><p>Howell, 21, and a classmate died on 30 April when a gunman opened fire in a classroom in the Kennedy building on UNCC’s campus. Four other students were injured, but police say Howell’s actions prevented more injuries or loss of life.</p><p>“You’re either going to run, hide and shield, or you’re going to take the fight to the assailant,” Charlotte-Mecklenburg police department Chief Kerr Putney said. “Having no place to run and hide, he did the last.”</p><p>Lauren Westmoreland, Howell’s longtime girlfriend, said in an email that Jedis were close to his heart.</p><p>“Though he wasn’t an artist, he loved to draw the clone trooper helmets all the time, sometimes even on my birthday cards,” Westmoreland said.</p><p>Lauren’s father, Kevin Westmoreland, said Howell studied the Star Wars universe for most of his life.</p><p>“He had a very strong sense of good and evil, and how to live life as someone who looked out for others,” Westmoreland said. “Seeing him listed as both a Jedi and a historian in Star Wars lore is a perfect way to connect him to this story and the characters he loved.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqZobK6eceorp6knGLCtHnSraydnZ6peri0zmabop2UYsGir8qloKefXZzCr7nAp2Sipl2otbC706KloGWYpLuwvsSdZJqrXZ%2BypbWMm6Con6KWvanFjLCgpKFdm66utcuyZJ%2BZo6l6p63CrapmsZ%2Bqeq%2BxxJ1kpKafrHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
