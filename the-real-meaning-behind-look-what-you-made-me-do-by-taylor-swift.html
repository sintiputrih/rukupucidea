According to <a href=#>Harper's Bazaar</a>, Swift's opening line "I don't like your little games / Don't like your tilted stage" specifically references the type of stage West had used in his 2016 Saint Pablo tour, one which moved above the audience and tilted so attendees could better view the rapper.&nbsp;Another obvious hint at the song's muses are the last lines of the bridge, "I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now / Why? Oh! 'Cause she's dead!" As Harper's Bazaar pointed out, this part of the bridge is the only one spoken and edited to sound like a voicemail recording.</p><p dir=ltr>It was the music video where Swift really left little guesswork, however. There are symbols of betrayal abound, from the CGI snakes handing Swift her tea, to the words "Et tu, Brute" etched on one arm of Swift's throne, <a href=#>Bustle</a> noted. In one scene, Swift, while seemingly impersonating a spoiled socialite, is making a recording on her phone, proclaiming that she's "totally gonna edit this later." Another "Swift," wearing her same dress from the 2009 VMAs, utters the words, "Um, I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative," echoing her July 2016 Instagram caption. It seems as if the singer-songwriter found a way to poke fun at herself while still getting in a dig at her rivals!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGhnan9ye9OhnGaqlZa5brnEmqWippdir6a0yKebZqSfpLhuw8eaq2axn6p6rq3DnmSmnV2ZvG6u2GarmrGcpL9uv9aina1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
