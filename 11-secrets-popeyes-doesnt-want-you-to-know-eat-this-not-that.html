The FDA recommends you eat no more than 2,300 American food of sodium a day.</p><p>RELATED: Sign up for our newsletter for more fast-food secrets and healthy eating tips.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/12/buffet.jpg><p>Apparently, at one time, many Popeyes locations were actually all-you-can-eat buffets. Over the years they have been sadly phased out. The last one standing in, Lafayette, LA, was made famous by Anthony Bourdain, who ate at the location for three days straight, enjoying the $8.99 price tag. Sadly according to Eater, the location is still there but the buffet did not survive the pandemic.</p><p>RELATED:&nbsp;11 Secrets Texas Roadhouse Doesn’t Want You to Know</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/03/popeyes-cajun-sprinkle.jpg><p>Skipping fried foods but missing all the flavor? Ask for the chain’s Cajun Sparkle spice, which is used on tots and some fried chicken, and is kept behind the counter, according to Mashable. Cajun Sparkle, which includes garlic powder, onion powder, and red and black pepper, tastes savory and spicy and really elevates the chain’s grilled options—it’s also great on anything fried too!</p><p>RELATED:&nbsp;We Tasted 5 Fast-Food Chicken Nuggets & These Are the Best</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/09/popeyes-ghost-pepper-wings.jpg><p>“One of the hallmarks of Popeyes chicken is the amount of flavor we get from marination, whether it’s a sandwich fillet, a piece of fried chicken, or a tender,” Amy Alarcon, head of culinary innovation for Popeyes, told Forbes. Just follow her recipe for roasted chicken, then fry it up in a very hot oil with a high smoke point, such as vegetable shortening or peanut oil.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/08/popeyes-exterior.jpg><p>You might think Popeyes was named for the cartoon character, but founder Al Copeland was a fan of the classic film The French Connection, and Popeye Doyle was a character played by Gene Hackman. Copeland reportedly just liked the character’s style!</p><p>RELATED:&nbsp;73 Healthy Chicken Recipes</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/03/popeyes-interior.jpg><p>Though the restaurant name reads as possessive, there’s never been an apostrophe in there anywhere. Copeland joked that he was “too poor” to afford one, reports Thrillist, when he started out, and later, even after the restaurant’s huge growth, he kept the branding consistent.</p><p>RELATED:&nbsp;7 Fast Food Logos With Hidden Messages</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-combo.jpg><p>A few years back, Popeyes made news nationwide for spending a whopping $43 million to buy their secret recipe for fried chicken, according to Thrillist. Even though Copeland relinquished control of the company in 1992, he had been charging the chain an annual royalties fee of $3.1 million to use the recipes. Now, Popeyes still has to pay the Copeland estate for spices, but they did get their hands on the recipes.</p><p>RELATED:&nbsp;11 Secrets KFC Doesn’t Want You to Know</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/11/popeyes-kitchen.jpg><p>Popeyes bright orange sign dots many rest-stops across the US, but when you see that sign on a late night, don’t get your hopes up for a chicken sandwich. We’re not sure why, but most rest area Popeyes offer an abbreviated menu, as people have noted on Reddit and Tripadvisor, and for some states, like Maine, those are the only locations.</p><p>RELATED:&nbsp;6 Secrets Popeyes Employees Don’t Want You To Know</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/03/popeyes-cajun-fries-1.jpg><p>While most fast food places don’t offer gravy, Popeyes offers gravy over their mashed potatoes.
