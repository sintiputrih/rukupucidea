His zodiac sign is Aquarius. Muyiwa did his elementary schooling at Christ Church School, Ibadan, and Mapo V, Elekuro, Ibadan, and went to St. David’s High School at Molete in Ibadan to pursue his high school education. While in school, he obtained the West Africa Secondary School Certificate. After completing his schooling, Muyiwa joined the Great Nigeria Insurance Company as a sales executive and worked there for a year. He then obtained a certificate in Chemistry from an institute affiliated with an institute in London. Thereafter, he pursued a Bachelor of Education degree in Adult Education from the University of Ibadan. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_2><a href=#>[2]</a></span> <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_3><a href=#>[3]</a></span> While Muyiwa was in elementary school, he tried acting for the first time. During one of the school’s plays, his classmate who was cast for the lead role in the play had an accident and could not perform. At that time, Muyiwa was picked up as his replacement by the school teachers. A similar incident occurred when he was in secondary school. Muyiwa replaced Ishola Ogunsola’s son who was earlier cast for a play. Despite being a science student, his interest in acting earned him the position of the Director of Publicity in the School’s Press Club. He had a corner on the school’s bulletin board named Muyi’s corner where he put up short poems, jokes, and cartoons.&nbsp; In his college days, he started writing scripts and also launched his first novel named Secrets of Death, which was encouraged by his English teacher, Mr. Aluko.</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/An-old-picture-of-Muyiwa-Ademola.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-71073 class=wp-caption-text>An old picture of Muyiwa Ademola</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Physical_Appearance></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Physical_Appearance></span><span style=color:purple>Physical Appearance</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Height (approx.): </strong>5′ 8″</p><p><strong>Hair Color: </strong>Black</p><p><strong>Eye Color: </strong>Black</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Muyiwa-Ademola-pic.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Family_Caste></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Family_Caste></span><span style=color:purple>Family & Caste</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He was born into the family of Prince Isaiah Ademola. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_4><a href=#>[4]</a></span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Parents_Siblings></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Parents_Siblings></span><strong>Parents & Siblings</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Muyiwa is the son of Isiah Ademola and Rebecca Ademola.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Relationships_Wife></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Relationships_Wife></span><strong>Relationships & Wife</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He was rumored to be in a relationship with the Yoruba actress Omo Kehinde Oluwadamilola Bankole (Sexy Winger).

He also shared that his family didn’t have a TV until he was in secondary school.</li></ul><ul><li>While sharing the details about his childhood in an interview, Muyiwa said,<br><p>I grew up in one of the “slummiest” slums in Ibadan. No electricity for several years, I had to make use of “kuufin” (local lamp) while reading for my SSCE (We had only one lantern which no one dare touch).

It is a film I like all Nigerians to watch as we talk about an issue most people ignore. Both the rich and the poor suffer from it; there is a need to show love to people living with bipolar. If you don’t do that, they will get to a point where they think everyone hates them, and committing suicide becomes the next option.”</p></li></ul><ul><li>In an interview, Ademola shared that there was a time in his life when he was so depressed that he felt that it was his end as an actor. It was his wife at that time who assured him that it was just a passing phase. Talking about it, he said,<br><p>I felt depressed during that period. I had stories that once you saw them, you would just go home and sleep. I felt dejected and thought it was over for me as an actor. But my wife helped me through those times.
