Maggie and Alex have another son, however, Buster Murdaugh, who maintains his father’s innocence and stood by him during court proceedings. But where was he in the evening of the gruesome crimes and how did he become the only surviving family member?</p><h2 id=h-who-is-buster-murdaugh data-injectable=false>Who is Buster Murdaugh?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/murdaugh-murders-5.jpeg><p data-characters=677 data-current-count=977 data-injectable=true>Buster Murdaugh, 29, shares the same name as his father, Richard Alexander Murdaugh Jr., but was given the nickname Buster after his great-grandfather, former South Carolina Fourteenth Circuit solicitor Randolph “Buster” Murdaugh Jr.. Before the 2021 murders, Buster was a law student at the University of South Carolina and worked for his father’s legal firm. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wall Street Journal</a>, Buster didn’t make it very far in college, however, as he was expelled in 2019 during his second semester for plagiarism. It’s widely reported that his dad then paid an attorney $60,000 to plead his case with the university and get him readmitted.</p><p data-characters=636 data-current-count=636 data-injectable=true>Following the renewed media attention his family has received over the last couple of years, a cold case that could be traced back to Buster has been reopened and is currently being investigated. Stephen Smith, an old classmate of the former law student, with whom he is rumored to have had an affair, was found dead in 2015 on a country road not far from the Murdaugh family estate. His death was ruled a hit-and-run, but no one was ever charged. Buster was also responsible for providing his brother Paul with a fake ID so he could buy alcohol, which ultimately led to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the death of 19-year-old Mallory Beach</a> during a boating accident.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Where was Buster when his father killed his mother and brother?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=616 data-current-count=916 data-injectable=true>Buster’s absence from the crime scene was naturally a big talking point at the time, as the only family member with no involvement in the shooting. Local South Carolina news agency <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FITSNews</a> reported that Buster was in York County, South Carolina that evening, with Buster later testifying to being in Rock Hill, at his girlfriend Brooklynn White’s house. They then received a phone call from Alex Murdaugh telling Buster that his mother and brother had been shot and immediately drove roughly 200 miles to Moselle Road where the family Islandton estate was situated and where Maggie and Paul were killed.</p><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>According to his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">testimony</a>, Alex started by asking Buster, over the phone, if he was sitting down, before telling him what had happened. “He sounded odd, and then he told me that my mom and my brother had been shot,” Buster revealed in court. He also said his father was “heartbroken” and “destroyed” when he arrived at Moselle.</p><p data-characters=849 data-current-count=1214 data-injectable=false>A <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FOX Nation documentary</a> which aired Aug. 31, 2023, contains Buster’s first interview since the trial, where he says the “love” he witnessed in his family is the reason why he still believes Alex did not kill his mother and brother. He also accuses the case against his dad of being “tilted,” “not fair,” and presenting “a crappy motive.” Despite all this, Buster thinks calling his father a “psychopath” is a “fair assessment” given his “lies,” stealing, and “manipulation,” particularly pertaining to the mammoth number of financial crimes he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pleaded guilty to on Sept. 22, 2023</a>. Alex said he pleaded guilty so his son could “see [him] take responsibility.” In the documentary, Buster also denies any involvement with Stephen Smith.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yuwdGdmK6fmGK6tr7DnqmsZaedsrOxjLCYrGWSqsC1sdFmpK6qlJbCqLSMnayroZ6cerW0xGaqoaefqbavs44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
