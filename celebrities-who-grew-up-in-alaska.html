The daughter of Republican politician <a href=#>Sarah Palin</a>, Bristol became a household name as a teenager when her mother's 2008 vice presidential campaign announced that she was pregnant. Following the announcement, the 18-year-old would become the face of abstinence (via <a href=#>ABC News</a>), even going so far as to appear on ABC Family's "Secret Life of the American Teenager" to spread her sex-should-wait-until-marriage message.</p><p dir=ltr>For years, being a young mother was central to her brand (she had her second child at 24 while still unmarried, per <a href=#>Reuters</a>), which made her a perfect candidate for MTV's reality series "Teen Mom." In 2018, she joined the cast of the OG show alongside Maci Bookout, Catelynn Baltierra, Amber Portwood, and Cheyenne Floyd. It seems, however, that the Wasilla native had a fairly negative experience on set as she quit after only one season, writing on <a href=#>Instagram</a> that the series "took away [her] peace."</p><p dir=ltr>Since stepping away from "Teen Mom OG," Palin hasn't appeared on reality TV in any capacity. The outspoken conservative hasn't even attempted to reboot her own short-lived Lifetime series, "Life's a Tripp." Instead, she's moved to Austin, Texas, and poured her energy into becoming one of the area's most successful real estate agents (per <a href=#>Austin Homeseeker</a>). While she seems to be enjoying this new life lived mainly out of the public eye, her social media accounts show that she makes regular trips back to the Last Frontier state.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamljboZ4gY6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGSwoJ9itLOx1masqWWZo3qiuMCsoppn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
