Amid Season 7 of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Summer House</a>&nbsp;airing on Bravo, one of the show’s stars,&nbsp;<strong>Danielle Olivera</strong>, 34, has opened up about her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>recent split</a> from chef&nbsp;<strong>Robert Sieber</strong>. “We broke up towards the end of last year,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a> on Feb. 22. “It just wasn’t working out. You know, it sucks because there’s no animosity.

And I’m not the easiest either. I expect a lot, and so those two things just didn’t work out.” Robert and his now-ex dated from July 2020 until November of 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>In a separate interview with Bravo’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Daily Dish</a>, Danielle detailed the timeline of their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>breakup</a> and said she does “not recommend” that timeline for anyone. “Robert and I have parted ways,” she told the outlet on Wednesday. “It happened right before <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Thanksgiving</a>, and I do not recommend a breakup right before the holidays. It is heartbreaking. It sucks. But, there’s no animosity between us. It just wasn’t working out.” She also told&nbsp;The Daily Dish&nbsp;that their careers are “stressful [and] insane”, which led to neglecting their communication skills. “We couldn’t communicate effectively, and we needed to find our own happiness, separately, unfortunately. I hope it’s for the best, but I can tell you right now, it feels really bad,” she concluded.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Although Danielle confirmed the heartbreak this week, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her co-stars</a> <strong>Lindsay Hubbard</strong>, 36, and&nbsp;<strong>Carl Radke</strong>, 38, seemingly confirmed the split in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ET&nbsp;</a>via, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>US Weekly</a>&nbsp;on Feb. 10. “Danielle’s been in a relationship with Robert [Sieber] — I don’t know if it’s still currently going or not. As far as we know, they are not together is what we are told,” Carl told the outlet. “But Danielle was in a serious relationship, and she traveled around and there was no animosity about her going away.” The former pair made their last public appearance at <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>BravoCon</a> in Oct. 2022 (see <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos</a> above).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ze5FrZqytnaKys3nHqKysnV2Zrq%2B1xKWjnmWfoba3sdGaZJunqZu%2FqrHNnWSrp5Kav7V50qKcm52iYq%2BzscCkrKln</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
