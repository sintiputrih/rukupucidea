In fact, she looks so good, the photo is making fans wonder if she has gotten any work done on her breasts.&nbsp;</p><p>While the reality star has always been somewhat voluptuous, sporting a rather bodacious bod, her boobs happened to look larger than usual. Take a look and see for yourself, but proceed with caution — her beauty might ultimately blow you away. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">It's Transformation Friday up in here, y'all.</h2><p>For a little additional frame of reference, here&nbsp;is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a photo of Brielle from 2016</a> from her Instagram... you can make your own judgment call regarding any differences you may notice.</p><p>Obviously, nothing is confirmed regarding this matter, and the reality star continues to deny ever having work done.
