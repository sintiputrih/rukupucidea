Brinson even sported a glam beanie accentuating the chill-elegant style exuding from both mother and daughter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/cbbfc5153aafdb720bcba432ee6106c0.jpeg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Savannah and LeBron James at the Sports Illustrated Sportsperson of the Year Ceremony on December 12, 2016 in New York. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>A BLESSED EASTER</strong></p><p class=Fg>Beyond the comfy clothes, both Gloria and Brinson appeared intensively relaxed in one another's company, perhaps implying a healthy and intimate relationship between the in-laws. Penning the caption, Gloria <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="http://www.instagram.com/p/CNRI3eID37s/?igshid=11vilejzooj72">wrote </a>a sweet tribute:</p><p class=Fg>"Hoping you all had a blessed and safe #eastersunday2021! From my family to yours ?."</p><p class=Fg>Both of their dark eyes twinkled as they stared deeply into the camera lens with wide and authentic smiles stretched across their faces. Brinson donned a light pink tracksuit while Gloria sported a blue tie-dye overall with black pants.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>A FAMILY THAT STICKS TOGETHER</strong></p><p class=Fg>The other two photos included pictures of Gloria with the rest of James' children and Gloria's grandkids. These are "Bronny" James Jr., Bryce Maximus James, and, lastly, little Zhuri James.</p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>Brinson expressed that she is incredibly respectful to him, his mom, and their kids.</strong></h3><p class=Fg>James and his mother's fans filled the comment section with adoration, although many asked where her famous son was. The Instagram share received an abundance of likes, with many complimentary emojis.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>A MOM'S STRENGTH</strong></p><p class=Fg>James and his mother share an infinitely deep bond, based on <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2020/10/12/lebron-james-calls-mom-gloria-after-title/5965300002/>the hardships</a> they had to struggle through together. Taking to FaceTime, James contacted Gloria following an NBA championship win to <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/SportsCenter/status/1315493776522084353>express</a> his gratitude towards her:</p><p class=Fg>"You are the reason why I'm able to even do this, Mom. You don't understand."</p><p class=Fg>Gloria gave birth to the now superstar basketball player when she was just 16 years old and a single mother. In his FaceTime with his mom, he congratulated her on her strength in raising him in such difficult conditions.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>THE POWER OF A WOMAN</strong></p><p class=Fg>Perhaps because of his mother, James is attracted to strong women such as his wife.

The two are high school sweethearts and have seven children together.</p><p class=Fg>One of these children is their little girl <a class="Xd a" href=#>Zhuri</a> who celebrated her 6th birthday last year. Naturally, the two loving parents didn't hesitate to pull out all the stops when it came to celebrating their precious child's special day.</p><p class=Fg>The day was filled with multi-colored balloons and other decorations, her name written via balloons in an arch-like shape. Brinson also allowed Zhuri to have a cup of "coffee" that day to commemorate her growing up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtscWpoZXqtscGrpqdlmpa6pr%2BMpqamZZehvLO1wGauop6VYsCiwsCnpZqgXaW8b7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
