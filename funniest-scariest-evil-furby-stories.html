Straight to the point, it's simply entitled, <a href=#>"What Happens When Your Furby Becomes Evil."</a> So it's not just the children who have experienced the trauma of an evil Furby 00 the adults know it well, too.</p><p>Christina writes in her blog, "The old Furby would have some change in personality based on how you treated it, but this one goes far beyond that with a multiple personality disorder. It has several very distinct personalities and doesn't come with the Furby anti-psychotic drugs it desperately needs." Those are some pretty hefty accusations! When a parent says a toy needs psych meds, something must be up.</p><p>So what exactly happened with this particular Furby that made this mom flip? At first, it was when the Furby began taking on different personas. It went from having a "valley girl" voice to speaking like a cowboy. OK, kinda weird, but not terrifying. But what happens next is. One day, the Furby just started shaking violently. Then it stopped. "All was silent for a moment," Christina writes. "And then what was in front of us was a Furby who no longer had the high-pitched girly voice, but instead a deep, growling voice with angry looking eyes." The sweet fuzzy toy became utterly mean. Since then, Christina started referring to it as "Damien the Dark Furby," who growled and snapped at her daughter. They didn't advertise that feature in the Toys 'R Us catalog.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAlHBqcWeWqruvtcSsq2ark5a%2FqrHSrWSerpmheqfB0ZuwZqukpL%2BqsdJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
