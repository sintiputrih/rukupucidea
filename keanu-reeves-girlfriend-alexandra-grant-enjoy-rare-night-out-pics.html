When asked about possibly marrying Reeves, she remained coy.</p><p>“Love at every level is deeply important to my identity. How’s that for dodging the question?” the Ohio native said. “I do not believe that isolation is the way. There is a period of isolation that I do as a painter, but I deeply value the experience of being in relationships.”</p><p>Photos from the couples’ double date showed the friends greeting each other warmly. The group dressed casually and were all masked up outside the restaurant. For their night on the town, Reeves and Grant dressed all in black, with the actor sporting a beanie and coat while his girlfriend wore a bomber jacket and scarf. At one point, Winter pulled a few boxes of Adidas out of the car for his old friend to sign.</p><p>The Lebanon native and painter were also spotted out and about in November 2020 when the Matrix 4 cast held a <a href=#>secret wrap party for their movie in Germany</a>.</p><p>The franchise’s fourth&nbsp;film&nbsp;began production in California and was temporarily put on pause in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic before <a href=#>moving overseas.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The cast and crew got away with the large mid-pandemic celebration by staging a party scene for the movie, which is set to be released in December.</p><p>Scroll down to see pics from Reeves’ date night.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKatza5kq52Vq7K0ecaiqaWeop6yr7CMmqOesJGjsbOtjKCpmqakYrKvts6yZKuZopp6r7XGoatmp6WperG1wqxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
