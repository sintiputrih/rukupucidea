The two came with their friends, danced, and their eyes met while they were resting. “There’s this gorgeous woman standing at the bar and she’s like … looking at me,” Martina said.</span></p><p><span>According to Julia, she gave Martina a kind of “Russian look — Really, it was more like, ‘Okay, you are coming to talk to me now.’”</span></p><p><span>However, their love story couldn’t move forward at the time.</span></p><p><span>Eight years later, the two reconnected at the French Open 2008, and only then, they started dating.

Unfortunately, the baby died just five months later of internal injuries.</span></p><p><span>According to Julia, her oldest daughter was very upset when she first heard of her mother’s relationship with Martina. One day, she just came from school and asked, “Who is Martina?”</span></p><p><span>Julia retorted, “Martina is someone I love. And I can’t imagine living without her.”</span></p><p><span>The mother-daughter then sat down and talked. And the conversation ended with her daughter saying, “I want her to live with us, too.”</span></p><p><span>At the time, Julia’s family split their time between France and US, and her daughter only spoke French and Russian.
