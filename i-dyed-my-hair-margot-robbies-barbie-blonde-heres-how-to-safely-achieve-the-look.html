According to beauty booking platform&nbsp;</span><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Fresha</a><span style=background-color:initial>&nbsp;the Barbie phenomenon has caused an 83% increase in requests for platinum blonde hair. Barbie-related beauty hashtags, including #barbienails, #barbiemakeup, #barbiebeauty, and #barbiehair, have garnered a staggering 171 million views in the past month on TikTok... if that's not enough the hashtag #barbieblonde has over a million views on the platform, proving this shade is certainly the most popular hair colour of summer 2023.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c7bcb22575bd-picture-source-glamour.jpg><p id=e6h2dDCKRO data-wc=64>Margot Robbie’s hair (well, wigs) for the movie was less of a warm blonde like the actual doll, and more platinum, with a slight hint of warmth through it. But how does one achieve this exact shade? I went to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Neville Hair and Beauty</a> in Belgravia, where experts worked their magic and completely transformed my hair without damaging it. Here’s how they did it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2ecdd65b0bae-neville-front-house-022019.jpg><h2 dir=ltr><strong>To prepare:</strong></h2><p id=ekDqasvnKF9 data-wc=49>Seniz Alkan, Colour Director at Neville explained: “It’s important to understand that this one-process colour is best suited to people who have a naturally light base colour. It's quite a statement look, therefore it is advised to go for a consultation with your colourist before making an informed decision”</p><p id=emGmek_FIa8 data-wc=24>She also recommends taking a photograph for visual references to establish your desired tone if there is a particular look you have in mind.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>How to achieve the look:</strong></h2><p id=ewRRNXir4Q data-wc=33>Admittedly, when heading downstairs in the salon on Pont Street, I was slightly nervous. Though I've been light blonde since forever (literally birth), this look is a much cooler shade than my usual.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ce723db50cfa-img1902.jpg><p id=eNEIMbND6x data-wc=84>I had a chat with Seniz first to discuss the process, and she decided it wasn’t necessary to do a scalp bleach on my hair as my natural colour was light enough. For those with slightly darker hair, carrying out a scalp bleach to lift the colour to a level 9 (the lightest colour on the scale), may be required, which is something a professional would assess. As this wasn't necessary for me, she went straight in with highlights in the lightest shade possible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fe4caf1d6e98-img1904.jpg><p id=eEauCySRX7 data-wc=42>After letting the colour take (with a helping hand from heat that radiated from an oscillating, UFO-looking contraption), a toner from Redken Shades EQ in the shade 10N was added through my hair to help avoid the colour turning brassy or green.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bd7e2a511c9b-img1903.jpg><p id=eLxoDbASsz data-wc=36>Adding a bonding treatment was another important step to ensure my hair wasn't damaged during this process. SOS - a protective treatment designed to strengthen the hair and recover moisture - was also applied all over.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fe9cea9800ea-img1905.jpg><p id=e_VfROwSTLO data-wc=37>After a sleep-inducing head massage and a hair wash using Kérastase products, I headed upstairs to the blow bar where Saffy-Lee gave me a Barbie-approved, super subtle, bouncy blow dry, which turned out exactly as I requested.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e360754840c1-img1907.jpg><h2 dir=ltr><strong>The result:</strong></h2><p id=ecwnjX9dzV data-wc=75>I could not get enough of my hair: it felt smooth, I felt confident and it was the perfect summer shade. Thanks to the team at Neville, I felt at ease and trusted them with my hair throughout the whole process. My blow dry was also the best I'd ever had. Granted, this shade of blonde isn't for the faint hearted, but the warmer tones running through it makes the end result less terrifyingly bright.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3dbebafb5a7a-img1908.jpg><p id=e7LFd3i9b2 data-wc=75>One thing I've learnt this summer thanks to the Barbiecore craze (both dressing in pink for a week and dying my hair potently blonde), is that stepping out of your comfort zone eventually brings nothing but satisfaction, even if it's scary at first. So whether you're thinking of going blonde or brunette, adopting a different dress agenda, or trying a smokey eye for the first time, this is your sign to give it a go.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>How to maintain bottle Blonde hair:</strong></h2><p id=e4Z3lcmiZ7I data-wc=75>“Barbie Blonde is a relatively high maintenance look, which requires getting your roots done every 4 weeks in addition to having regular treatments and glosses to preserve the condition of the hair," the salon said in a press release. "Furthermore, Seniz advises the use of the Kerastase Blonde Absolu bain Ultra-Violet purple shampoo, conditioner and mask for home use between salon visits. It's also really important is the use of the Blonde Absolut Heat Protector.”</p><p id=epj7Gx9yfoT style=font-size:12px data-wc=42><a class=hm-link href=#>FAQ page</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue5NycG5oaWS2brDYnptmpalitaK10WakmqqXpMFuvs6bmaKdo2Kvor7Bopxmmpyku6WxjKGcq52jYrWww4ytpmarkZuyrcWMmpqhoZWrsm7Ax55kpaefoHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
