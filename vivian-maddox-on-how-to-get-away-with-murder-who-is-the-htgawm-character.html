When he discovered she smelled like vodka, he mentioned wanting to help her before it’s too late like it was for his mom. So, what does too late mean?</p><p>With the <a href=#>return of How To Get Away With Murder happening in 2019</a>, there will be a lot of questions that need to be addressed. The final scene of the finale showed Annalise in her home and Gabriel walking in as she tells him she knows who he is.

It was brought up while Gabriel was being talked about, so the suspicion that it may be Vivian Maddox has been discussed among fans. At this point, anything is possible.</p><p>Seeing Vivian Maddox when How To Get Away With Murder returns wouldn’t be surprising. The show is known for flashbacks and if she is really dead, this would be the ideal way to introduce her. Annalise knows who she is, and now she knows who Gabriel really is too.</p><p>Annalise was the other woman in the relationship between Sam and Vivian. He left his wife to be with her, and now&nbsp;he is dead and she is back to drinking again.
