After <a href=#>Tekashi 6ix9ine’s</a> girlfriend, Sarah “Jade” Wattley, revealed a late-night Instagram DM from Offset on Tuesday, deeply uncreative, sexually explicit tweets were published from his Twitter account. Now, <a href=#>Cardi B and Offset</a> are saying the occurrences were the result of a hack. But things between Jade, Offset, and Cardi B are just <a href=#>too complicated</a> to let this alleged hack slide. So, here’s what’s really happening with Offset’s hack, Cardi B, and Jade.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3rml3yy00143h672fz6g00c@published data-word-count=109><strong>Who is Jade and why is Offset DMing her?&nbsp;</strong><br>First question, easy. Jade, also known as “__ohsoyoujade” on Instagram is <a href=#>Tekashi 6ix9ine</a>’s girlfriend, if you couldn’t tell from her massive tattoo of his face. They both love a subtle tattoo. Jade works at Angels Strip Club in Queens, New York. If you ask Offset, he did not slip n’ slide into her DMs late Monday night. But if you ask Jade, he was absolutely in there, splashing around, saying “Miss u fr.” Tuesday afternoon, Jade posted a video of her phone screen (not to be confused with a screen recording) showing the unopened DM from the middle of the night.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tekashi 69 girlfriend “jade” claims Offset dm her “miss u”. Btw offset wife Cardi B is facing criminal charges for allegedly giving jade THE BEATS in a strip club after she allegedly messed with offset before?

Last year, Cardi B <a href=#>surrendered herself </a>to the NYPD due to her involvement in an assault at Angels Strip Club in Queens. Two Angels bartenders, the aforementioned Jade and her co-worker <a href=#>Baddie Gi</a>, accused Cardi B of throwing a bottle at them and getting her entourage to attack them in August 2018. Now, investigators are determining whether or not Cardi B was involved. TMZ reported that Jade also sustained injuries <a href=#>in a separate attack</a> from Cardi B at the same strip club. (This web gets all the more tangled when you remember that Cardi B was one of the many, many, many people that <a href=#>Tekashi 6ix9ine snitched on</a> in court.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3rml4ba00193h67vbjhntf0@published data-word-count=94><strong>Do we think it’s because Cardi B thought Offset was cheating with Jade?</strong><br>Well, <a href=#>Nicki Minaj thinks so</a>. Minaj, who has openly feuded with Cardi B in the past and is not what we would call a reliable source, claimed on Queen Radio that Cardi B incited fights because of Offset’s infidelity. “You getting girls beat up because of what your man’s doing?” the rapper said on Queen Radio, following her own fight with Cardi B. “Who are you angry at, sweetheart? You got these women crying and scared to leave their house.” [sips tea]</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3rml4d6001b3h67bzpw4m3x@published data-word-count=43><strong>Alright, well, that’s for the courts to decide. How can Offset deny alley-ooping into Jade’s DMs? We see the video!&nbsp;</strong><br>The Migo claims those DMs are the result of a hack and he has his own video of a phone screen to prove it.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Offset explains the hack <a href=#>#cardib</a> <a href=#>#6ix9ine</a> gf <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8gDMwQpDF2</a></p>— BallerAlert (@balleralert) <a href=#>December 4, 2019</a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3rml5dv001c3h670339i84v@published data-word-count=59>“Go to my email, boom. Somebody hacked one of my emails that’s connected to all my sh*t. And that’s how I got hacked from the jump,” Offset said in a video posted to Cardi B’s <a href=#>Instagram story</a>. “I’ve been having a good weekend. I wake up to the bullsh*t. I’m with my family. I ain’t on no stupid sh*t.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3rml5fx001d3h672c98bcyz@published data-word-count=78>The email in the video, however, is an email from Instagram replying to Offset’s report that his account has been hacked. Not exactly conclusive evidence. He also provided a video showing direct messages from a fan letting him know that an account has been posting leaked music for months. As of writing, Offset still has not regained access to his Instagram account, though he claims Google, Facebook, and Twitter are all on looking into his supposedly compromised accounts.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3rml5he001e3h675kk7criv@published data-word-count=39><strong>It’s 2019 and you’re telling me Offset got hacked because he has the same passwords for all his accounts?

But come on now, [he’s] not dumb, he’s not crazy, we’ve been so good, we had a sweet weekend, our life has been good, he’s not going to play himself like that. That’s why I’m not going to entertain that, that’s why I’m not getting rowdy.
