A study published by real estate brokerage Redfin on Monday found that a high share of home sellers dropped their asking price in July, particularly in former pandemic boomtowns.
Boise, Idaho, which was a top destination for West Coast remote workers during the pandemic, saw 70 percent of listings slashed in July, up from just a third a year ago."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

the analysis had fewer than 15 percent of home listings that were reduced from their initial asking price.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>More than half of the cities with the biggest share of price drops–Boise, Denver, Tacoma, Sacramento, Phoenix, San Diego and Portland–were among the 20 housing markets that cooled fastest in the first half of 2022.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Redfin notes those markets had attracted scores of eager homebuyers during the pandemic, when tech workers and other white collar workers fled more expensive markets and drove home prices up in smaller
