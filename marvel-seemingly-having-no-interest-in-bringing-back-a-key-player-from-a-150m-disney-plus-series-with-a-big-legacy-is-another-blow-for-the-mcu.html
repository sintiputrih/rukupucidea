Unfortunately, one member of the team who’s already in the MCU apparently doesn’t have a good chance of returning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/elijah-bradley-patriot-the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-young-avengers-e1684933452582.jpg><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=727 data-injectable=true>Namely, Eli Bradley, who goes by the superhero name Patriot in the comics. Just as in the source material, Eli was introduced as the grandson of super-soldier Isaiah Bradley in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, as played by Elijah Richardson. Despite having done half the work already, it’s claimed that “Marvel doesn’t seem to have any interest in pursuing anything Elijah Bradley related, unfortunately.”</p><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>Given that the entire point of the Bradleys’ story is that Isaiah’s legacy as the first “Captain America” has been stricken from the history books, Marvel writing out his grandson from the Young Avengers team wouldn’t be a great look if it comes to pass. It would also be a pretty mystifying decision, seeing as The Falcon and the Winter Soldier‘s story will continue in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Captain America: Brave New World</a> anyway, so it’s not like the studio is embarrassed by the Disney Plus show.</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false>Eli could well prove to be a big player in the MCU’s Young Avengers after all (and certainly deserves to be) but it looks like he might be in danger of following Harry Styles’ Eros yet another <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">once-promising Multiverse Saga lost in the ether</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yurdGvnKVlo5qyrrXNoKOyZZiWw6q6xmalqGWZo8GmvsSsq2ahnmKvs7XNoKCnn12XrqS3jJpkpJ2pYr2trdieqWaeoqS6bq2MamxppV2ZtrS6xLJkqaSlqHq0sdGinKxlp57BqXnAZpmin12hsqitwrJkoqtdlruwwMeeqWaanKTEbrLOq2StoJViuqTBjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
