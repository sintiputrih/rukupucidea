Salvador Perez and Mallory Zapata are one of the fan-favorite couples of Love Is Blind season 2, but that didn’t stop Sal from feeling a bit jealous and insecure after listening to Mallory’s chat with Jarrette Jones in Mexico. In the pods, Jarrette and Mallory connected over their love of sports. Mallory grew up with two brothers, so she’s a big sports fan."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

SPOILERS ahead for&nbsp;Love Is Blind season 2 episodes 1-5 below!</strong></p><p>Salvador Perez and Mallory Zapata are one of the fan-favorite couples of&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Love Is Blind</a></strong> season 2, but that didn’t stop Sal from feeling a bit jealous and insecure after listening to Mallory’s chat with Jarrette Jones in Mexico. In the pods, <a href=#>Jarrette and Mallory connected</a> over their love of sports. Mallory grew up with two brothers, so she’s a big sports fan. Jarrette loved that and noted how hard it can be to find a girl who likes sports and can be with him watching a game on TV.</p><p>As the pods went on, Mallory eventually came up with a nickname for Jarrette: “JerBear.” Nonetheless, Jarrette eventually got engaged to Iyanna McNeely, whereas Mallory chose to get engaged to Salvador. Once all the engaged couples met each other during the couples’ retreat, however, Nick pointed out that he could feel some lingering tension between Jarrette and Mallory. Jarrette <a href=#>admitted to Nick that he knew</a> how pretty Mallory was even in the pods, just by the sound of her voice. All night long, Salvador was clearly nervous about something. Mallory asked him about it, but he played it off as no big deal.</p><p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag>SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Love Is Blind: Shayne & Shaina’s Chemistry In The Pods Was Superficial</a></span></p><p>After Nick insisted that Jarrette should at least have&nbsp;a conversation with Mallory to make sure that they were fine, he finally decided to sit down and talk with Mallory. She asked him if she looked like what he expected, and he said that she looked exactly how he had seen her during a dream. Then, Mallory admitted to crying a lot when they parted ways in the pods. Mallory said that she had no clue that she was Jarrette’s “number-one person” in the pods, which he was very confused about. When Jarrette asked Mallory if she was ready to get <a href=#>married at the end of Love Is Blind</a>, she responded by making a face and taking a sip from her drink.</p><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Later, the conversation became about all of the things Jarrette and Mallory already knew they had in common, which felt like they were flirting with each other all over again in the pods. They even started calling each other by their nicknames again. Jarrette then pointed out that Mallory would’ve preferred to have a gold engagement ring, which is something she had told Jarrette in the pods. Mallory replied that she liked the ring Sal got her, but she did agree that her dream engagement ring would’ve been gold. Out of nowhere, the scene shifted to a confessional with Salvador that was filmed during the same party. A <a href=#>producer pointed out that Salvador looked</a> “kind of bummed,” with Sal looking on-camera like he was on the verge of crying. “I know that she’s not interested in me. And I want to go home,” he told the producer.</p><p>The next day, Salvador and Mallory had a date where he explained where his jealousy came from and then apologized for going to bed angry. Mallory said in a confessional that Jarrette is the typical kind of guy that she’s dated in the past, but she loves Salvador and feels a much deeper connection with him. Alas, in episode five, Salvador approached Mallory again about the conversation she had at the party because he had heard her say&nbsp;“We don’t necessarily have to get married”&nbsp;to Jarrette. She didn’t deny saying it, but she explained that she said it in a general way. At <a href=#>the end of Love Is Blind season 2</a>, the couples can choose whether or not they will go through with getting married,&nbsp;so that’s apparently&nbsp;all that she meant by it.</p><p><span class=next-single>More:&nbsp;<a href=#>Love Is Blind 2: All Of Abhishek’s Red Flags In The Pods</a></span></p><p><strong>Love Is Blind</strong>&nbsp;season 2 airs Fridays at 3 a.m. ET / 12 a.m. PT on Netflix.</p><p><strong><span class=next-btn-text-title>Everything Revealed During Nintendo Direct (February 2022)</span></strong></p><p><strong class=section-sub-title>About The Author</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DE4A780F-3713-404D-B51C-F38C0B5EC34C-1-201-a-1.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><strong class=bio-title><br>Bernardo Sim<br><span class=amount>(1681 Articles Published)</span><br></strong><p>Bernardo Sim writes about TV shows, queer culture, & Brazilian media.
