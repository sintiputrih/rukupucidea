It needs to be warmed to about 110-120 degrees.</li><li><strong>Yeast</strong> — make sure your yeast is working by letting it proof with the warmed milk and some sugar.</li><li><strong>Sugar</strong> — this helps the yeast to activate and also adds sweetness to the bread.</li><li><strong>Flour</strong> — use all-purpose or bread flour in this recipe.</li><li><strong>Salt</strong> — a flavor enhancer and integral ingredient in baking.</li><li><strong>Butter</strong> — use unsalted butter. If you only have salted butter, reduce the salt amount by 1/4 teaspoon.</li></ul><p><strong>Cinnamon Sugar Filling Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>Butter, Sugar, and Cinnamon (you can make your own cinnamon sugar mixture or buy from the grocery store)</li></ul><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Star-Bread-11-720x727.jpg alt="This Star Bread is a pull-apart bread that is perfectly soft and fluffy and filled with your favorite fillings.

Let sit until it becomes foamy and begins to bubble. This should take about 5-10 minutes.&nbsp;</li><li>Add in melted butter, remaining sugar, and eggs. Add flour and salt. Mix at low speed until the dough begins to form a ball. I like to use my Bosch mixer for this recipe. Knead the dough in your mixer or by hand for 8-10 minutes.</li><li>Shape the dough into a ball and place in a bowl sprayed with non-stick cooking spray or oiled. Cover the bowl and let rise, until double in size, about 1-2 hours, depending on the warmth of your kitchen.</li></ul><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cinnamon-Sugar-Star-Bread-Dough-rolled-into-a-circle-720x968.jpg alt="Cinnamon Sugar Star Bread Dough rolled into a circle" width=720 height=968 data-pin-description="Cinnamon Sugar Star Bread Dough rolled into a circle" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><ul><li>After the dough has doubled, place it on a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces. I suggest using a very sharp knife or pizza cutter to cut it into 4 pieces.</li><li>Roll each dough ball into a 12-inch circle. Place on a piece of parchment paper to make it easier to transfer to a baking sheet. Brush the first layer of dough with melted butter for the filling and then sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.

Place a small round cookie cutter or glass (about 3-4 inches) in the center of the dough. Use a sharp knife and cut the circle into quarters.

Make sure your milk is at an ideal temperature of 110-120 degrees. If it is too hot, it will kill the yeast.</li><li><strong>Give it time to rise for the 1st time</strong>. This is the only long rise so the dough needs to at least double in size.</li><li><strong>Once you form it into a star shape, don’t let it rise again for too long</strong> or it will puff up too much and lose the star shape.</li><li><strong>Don’t overbake the star bread</strong>. Watch carefully.</li></ul><h3>Popular Bread Recipes:</h3><p class=block-pinterest-cta__title>Pin this now to find it later</p><a href=# title="Share on Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class=wp-element-button data-postid=26592 data-pin-do=none data-social-network=Pinterest data-social-action=Pin data-social-target=https://www.modernhoney.com/star-bread/>Pin It</a><h4 class="wprm-recipe-group-name wprm-recipe-ingredient-group-name wprm-block-text-bold">Cinnamon Sugar Filling:</h4><h4 class="wprm-recipe-group-name wprm-recipe-ingredient-group-name wprm-block-text-bold">Cream Cheese Frosting (optional):</h4><ul class=wprm-recipe-instructions readability=23><li id=wprm-recipe-26615-step-0-0 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=3><p><span>In a mixing bowl, combine warm milk, yeast, and 1 teaspoon of sugar.
