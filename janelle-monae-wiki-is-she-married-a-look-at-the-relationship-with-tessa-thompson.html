A Look At The Relationship With Tessa Thompson</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-05-31</div><p><strong>Fans who are interested in learning more about Janelle Monáe personal life and marital status have made her husband one of the most well-liked topics on the entire planet.</strong></p><p>We have the information you need if you’re searching for Janelle Monáe’s husband. Up to the very end, we’ll try to learn more about her life. The Wondaland Arts Society, Janelle Monáe Robinson’s company, and Atlantic Records are home to the American singer, rapper, and actor.</p><p>Monáe has been nominated for eight Grammys. In 2010, Monáe won an MTV Video Music Award and the ASCAP Vanguard Award. Monáe received the titles of Billboard Women in Music Rising Star in 2015 and Trailblazer of the Year in 2018. In 2012, Monáe was named a CoverGirl ambassador.</p><p>The Boston City Council proclaimed October 16, 2013, “Janelle Monáe Day” in honor of Janelle Monáe’s advocacy and creative prowess. Janelle Monáe Robinson was raised in the working-class neighborhood of Quindaro. She was born in Kansas City, Kansas, on December 1, 1985.</p><p>Janet, her mother, was a janitor and hotel maid. Michael Robinson Summers, her father, was a truck driver. When Monáe was a little child, her parents divorced, and her mother later wed a postal worker. Kimmy, Monáe’s younger sibling, is an offspring of her mother’s second marriage.</p><h2>Janelle Monáe is married, right?</h2><p>Janelle Monae is renowned for keeping her private life private, yet she has made several transgender-specific revelations. Monae claimed that she is pansexual in a 2018 interview with RollingStone. She continued by saying that although she had previously identified as bisexual, she had come to realize that pansexuality was a better fit for her sexual preferences.</p><p>Janelle previously stated that she didn’t care about a person’s sexual orientation as long as there was love in an interview with Sway in the Morning. In January 2020, Janelle tweeted #IAmNonBinary, which naturally piqued people’s interest. Monae discussed the significance of her widely shared tweet with TheCut. Monae described her goal of increasing community awareness in the general public.</p><h2>Relationship History of Tessa Thompson and Janelle Monáe</h2><p>When Tessa briefly appeared in Monae’s yoga video, rumors about Tessa and Janelle’s relationship began to spread. After that, they started traveling and going to award shows together. Later, Tessa portrayed Janelle’s lover in the sultry Pynk music video from 2018. Thompson later came out as bisexual after Janelle claimed to be pansexual.</p><p>In an interview with Net-a-Porter, Thompson discussed her relationship with Monae and said the following. “We share a unique bond.” We resonate at the same frequency since we are so close together. Others having prior ideas about who or what we are is acceptable. I’m not concerned about it.</p><p>The majority of people believed Tessa when she said she was dating Monae. On Twitter, Thompson offered an explanation for the situation, writing, “I didn’t state that I was in a relationship.” Later, Tessa referred to Monae and herself as “women free of fixed identities and sexualities” in an interview with The Cut. She did not, however, make it clear whether she was seeing Monae. Although there have been ongoing speculations linking the two, we won’t know for sure until they confirm it.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
