Give the girl a lollipop to hold please. What happened to her acting and sounding like a well put together adult? Please get Victoria an eye Dr appt right away because she needs glasses to realize Claire is an adult. If they wanted her to act like she is 10 then perhaps, they should have rewritten history to accommodate that.</p><p><span class=post-likes>11 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Vixhen</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>June 19, 2024, 6:22pm <span itemprop=position>19</span></span><p>Right?
