That doesn't mean we're adapting all these comics, but that the feel, the look, or the tone of them are touchstones for our team. Check 'em out! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/34KrVPeEL5</a></p>— James Gunn (@JamesGunn) <a href=#>February 2, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=true>So what are these comics? First up, we have All-Star Superman by writer Grant Morrison and artist Frank Quitely, which shouldn’t come as a surprise, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gunn has already championed this particular work</a> on social media. Next, there’s The Authority Omnibus by writer Warren Ellis and artist Bryan Hitch. Again, another obvious pick there, considering <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Authority movie that was just announced</a>.</p><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true>Thirdly, Gunn highlights <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">another Grant Morrison effort</a> — their run on Batman alongside artist Andy Kubert. It was during this run that Damian Wayne first appeared on the scene, so we can expect these comics to be a big influence on The Brave and the Bold. Last but not least, there’s Absolute Swamp Thing, Alan Moore’s groundbreaking DC debut that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">changed the titular character forever</a>.</p><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=201 data-injectable=false>That’s a lot of pages of comics goodness Gunn has outlined there, so that should keep DC fans plenty busy while we wait for the DCU to officially kick off with Superman: Legacy on July 11, 2025.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooZqllah6qMHNp2Srnaaarq2%2FjK2fnmVkYrimxYycpqahk2KvsLvKrGSippahwqa6wqKloGWknbJusMKuZJ%2BtpKq%2Fpns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
