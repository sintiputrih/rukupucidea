It has a lot of meaning to him as it represents a demon Jeff Hardy has struggled with for years.</p><p>“I started my big back tattoo back in July with the idea that I might have that disease called alcoholism or something. Maybe I’ll get a tattoo of what that looks like because naturally I’ve spoken about demons through my entire career. It gets to the point where I’m tired of talking about demons. Then when I got in trouble on October 3rd I struggled to get it finished, it’s not completely finished, but I realize man that’s my disease and it’s got the blues because I’m not feeding it.”</p><p>Jeff Hardy said his new back tattoo is his favorite yet. It is also a good way to look back and know how dangerous life can be if he starts drinking again.</p><p>Hardy is preparing for his return to WWE television. He did make a return before WrestleMania for one match, but they are currently laying down the landscape for him to do even more in the company.</p><p>Fans haven’t been given the best look at this new tattoo yet. It’s pretty massive as you can see from brief view we saw of it during his last SmackDown match. We took a photo from Hardy’s shirtless Swanton Bomb and flipped it. It’s the best we have for now.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>If you use the quotes credit <a href=#>Ringside News</a></p><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
