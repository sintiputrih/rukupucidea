Over the course of their nearly two-decade marriage, the husband and wife experienced a number of highs and lows. Nevertheless, they consistently managed to overcome it, making them among the cutest pairs in the business.</strong></p><h2><span id=In_2001_Chip_and_Joanna_Gaines_met_in_Waco_Texas>In 2001, Chip and Joanna Gaines met in Waco, Texas.</span></h2><p>Chip had considered marrying Joanna Gaines even before they had ever met in person when he seen a picture of her at her father’s store. Gaines, 45, said in an interview with PopSugar that he knew Joanna would be his wife the moment he saw “the picture on the wall.”</p><h2><span id=Their_First_Meeting_Was_Caused_by_Chip8217s_Broken_Car_Brake>Their First Meeting Was Caused by Chip’s Broken Car Brake</span></h2><p>Chip Gaines went another time to get his car’s brakes replaced at Joanna’s father’s automotive business shop. Fortunately, Joanna was working in the office and her father was not around. When Joanna and Chip first met, his personality captivated her. She stated to PopSugar:</p><p>“We clicked right away when we first met in the waiting area. He had such a genuine smile and was so engaging.</p><p>Joanna said to the publication that it took her a few months to be vulnerable with Chip. She added that she appreciated his generosity and that she knew she could put her trust in him.</p><p>In 2001, Chip and Joanna Gaines began dating. On their first date, the couple sat on the Waco restaurant porch. The two also relished the restaurant’s fried chicken.</p><h2><span id=On_their_first_date_Chip_Gaines_arrived_an_hour_and_a_half_later_than_expected>On their first date, Chip Gaines arrived an hour and a half later than expected.</span></h2><p>According to their autobiography The Magnolia Story, Chip Gaines arrived at Joanna’s place an hour and a half late for their first date. Joanna added that Chip made no effort to apologize for his tardiness. She said, “Only Chip could be an hour and a half late and have nobody get upset about it.”</p><p>Joanna, on the other hand, said that Chip was a completely different man that day than she had seen in her dad’s shop. Chip, according to her, was bald, had on a baseball cap, and had a countenance that suggested he had spent the day working outside “in the hot sun.”</p><p>It was then revealed that Chip had shaved his head in order to show his support for his friend who was facing cancer.</p><h2><span id=It_Was_Months_Until_Their_Second_Date>It Was Months Until Their Second Date</span></h2><p>Chip and Joanna Gaines didn’t see each other again for months following their initial date. According to Chip, he and his roommate John had placed a wager on “who could go longer without calling their dates back.” Chip said that he didn’t call Joanna because he was too focused on winning the $50 wager with John.</p><p>Following that, they began dating regularly, and when they went out more, they discovered that they had certain things in common, such as having grown up in “religious” environments. This fact facilitated their quick connection.</p><h2><span id=Additionally_Joanna_and_Chip_Gaines_Have_Other_Things_in_Common>Additionally, Joanna and Chip Gaines Have Other Things in Common</span></h2><p>Despite having completely different personalities, Joanna and Chip coincidentally have certain things in common. Despite having different birth states, they eventually relocated to Texas.</p><p>Chip relocated to Colleyville, Texas, when he was eight years old. He was born in New Mexico in 1974. Conversely, Joanna, who was born in Kansas in 1978, moved to Austin, Texas, when she was twelve years old, together with her family.</p><p>Additionally, Chip and Joanna both received their degrees from Baylor University in Waco, three years apart. Joanna earned a degree in communications in 2001, while Chip finished in 1998 with a degree in marketing.</p><p>They Got Married After A Year of Dating Chip and Joanna stayed together for another year till the former made the decision to ask his then-girlfriend to marry him in 2002. Chip had told Joanna they were go to a private performance that day. But he took her to a mall near the hometown of his parents.</p><p>Chip knelt down there and asked her to marry him. Chip asked Joanna out without a ring. Rather, he brought her to a jewelry store in the mall where Joanna could create her own engagement ring.</p><h2><span id=The_Engagement_Ring_of_Joanna_Gains>The Engagement Ring of Joanna Gains</span></h2><p>Joanna selected a round diamond and a platinum setting with an antique appearance there in the jewelry store. As stated in Joanna’s latest book, The Magnolia Story, she got engaged.</p><p>“Sitting there with Billy, creating the ideal ring was so much fun. Chip observed every moment of it with patience as he sat there.</p><p>The newly engaged pair was informed by the ring’s designer, Billy Holder—a friend of Chip’s father since high school—that the ring would require additional time to finish. He so provided Joanna an alternative ring to wear on that particular day.</p><p>Chip popped the question and took her to a tiny hotel in Archer City, where his sister, parents, and little sister were waiting to celebrate their engagement.</p><h2><span id=In_Waco_Texas_Chip_and_Joanna_tied_the_knot_2003>In Waco, Texas, Chip and Joanna tied the knot 2003</span></h2><p>Chip and Joanna Gaines, who had been dating for two years, got married on May 31, 2003, at Waco’s Earle Harrison House. Joanna told Us Weekly that the location was quite similar to where they went on their first date.</p><p>During their honeymoon, the newlyweds traveled to New York City and lodged at the Drake Hotel.</p><h2><span id=Before_getting_married_they_had_moved_in_together_for_a_year>Before getting married, they had moved in together for a year.</span></h2><p>Chip urged his fiancée to move in with him shortly after they got engaged, which reportedly went against their conventional Christian ideals. In an interview with Jefferson Bethke, Chip acknowledged that it wasn’t suitable at the time.</p><p>In a charming Instagram post from August 2015, Joanna remembered the day Chip invited her to move in. “I remember crying when Chip said we were moving in,” she recalled at that point. This is the article:</p><p>They took up residence in an 800-square-foot cottage that Chip rented out. Joanna claimed that although the property smelled awful and was run-down, “we fixed it up and fell in love with it.”</p><h2><span id=The_names_and_ages_of_Chip_and_Joanna_Gaines8217_five_children_show_that_they_are_proud_parents>The names and ages of Chip and Joanna Gaines’ five children show that they are proud parents.</span></h2><p>In addition to being a charming married pair, Joanna and Chip Gaines take great pride in being the parents of five kids. Nearly a year after their marriage, they had a child. Drake Gaines (16) was born to them on May 4, 2004. The hotel where the Gaines spent their honeymoon inspired the name of their first child.</p><p>On October 23, 2006, two years later, they welcomed Ella Rose Gaines, 13, into their family as their second child. On May 23, 2008, their third child, a son named Duke Gaines (12), was born.</p><p>The 17-year married couple acknowledged in a People interview that their marriage is not flawless. But Chip continued, it’s the relationship that he and Joanna are “extremely proud of.”</p><p>“Solid mutual respect is our secret ingredient to our marriage and working relationship,” Chip remarked. He continued,</p><p>“We are undoubtedly at odds. It isn’t flawless. It takes a lot of effort to reach a mutually respectful place, but once you do, you have the power to transform the world.</p><p>In addition, Chip mentioned that during their early married days, they had come to understand one other’s strengths. According to him, they enjoyed spending time together and frequently took on new projects.</p><p>He claimed that early on, they understood that pulling together rather than against one another was stronger, and that this realization is, in fact, the key to their happy marriage.</p><p>The couple’s 17th wedding anniversary is in a few days. In advance, happy anniversary of marriage!</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also, Read, Jonathan Gillibrand, Faizon Love, and Manual Dallori."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":12,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":31}{"1":33,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":64}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":12,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jonathan-gillibrand/"}{"1":31}{"1":33,"2":"https://popularbio.com/faizon-love/"}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":"https://popularbio.com/manuel-dallori/"}{"1":64}'>Also, Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Gillibrand</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Faizon Love</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Manual Dallori</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>celebrity couple</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Zijie Yan Wife: Meet Generous Scientist Family And Two Daughter</a></h3>Learn more about Zijie Yan's wife, a scientist, in the information below.
