With Scarecrow looking for his brain, Tin Woodsman pining for a heart, Cowardly Lion seeking courage, and Dorothy wanting nothing more than to find her way back to her friends and family, this motley crew had a long journey before them. And as they made their way down the yellow brick road and to the Emerald City, they discovered the power of friendship, love, bravery, and wisdom.</p><p></p><p>And though we'll always love the quote, "There's no place like home," (because, truly, there is no place quite as good as home) there are plenty of wise words to live by in this film. They don't all come from the Wizard, either. Dorothy, Glinda, Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion all have their share of lines and lessons we hold in our hearts. By the end of the flick, all these characters had found what they were looking for. And, as an audience, we'd also found some inspirational mottos and daily affirmations to live by. And, yeah, those songs get stuck in our head, too — but we don't mind singing along all day to "Follow the Yellow Brick Road."</p><p><strong>Check out the gallery below to see some of the beautiful</strong> <strong>Wizard of Oz</strong> <strong>quotes that have stayed with us over the years.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46woLOZopl6sLKMqLFmoZ6ovaq%2BwK2gqKaRoXqywc6tnKxlYWmBcn%2BSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
