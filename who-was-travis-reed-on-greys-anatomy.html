You might remember Reed as the bright-eyed sports star whose story went from miraculous to disastrous as the episode went on. Viewers were introduced to Reed in a flashback in which he met one of the main characters on the show, Dr. Cristina Yang. At the time, Yang was still in residency. Her meeting with Reed would present the budding doctor with one of her biggest challenges yet – a valve replacement. As the pro snowboarder went through the surgery and the subsequent process of recovery, he and Yang became close friends.&nbsp;</p><p>Later on, after Reed developed arthritis, Yang passed the athlete’s care over to Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), and it was here where things went south. There were a few complications during Reed’s surgery — including a sponge left in his body — which led to the loss of both of his legs, transforming the snowboarder into a double amputee overnight. He blamed Torres, and this led to the climactic trial that had Torres with everything on the line. While a judge eventually ruled in Calile’s favor, it was a traumatizing case that took a lot out of both sides.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tor5ikerit0marq5mmnsBuvsSem2annmK0s7HYrGSappGpvK7Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
