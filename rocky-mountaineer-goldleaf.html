You can embark on a two-day, one-night journey between Vancouver and Banff or Lake Louise. For a longer excursion, you can book a four-day, three-night jaunt between Jasper and Vancouver.</p><p>Additionally, you can choose to extend your vacation to a full 14 days by adding hiking trips or tours to your package. While there are no sleeper cars aboard the train, the excursion does include hotel stays along each portion of your journey.</p><p>Literally, your only true responsibility aboard the Rocky Mountaineer GoldLeaf is to relax. The hosts will book your hotel stay, deliver the keys to you onboard the train, and at the end of the day, you’ll arrive already checked in.</p><p>Inside your room, your luggage will be waiting.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-241567 alt="Dining Car View" width=800 height=901 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dining-car-view.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-241567 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Rocky Mountaineer/Facebook </span><span class=caption-body>View from the dining car aboard Rocky Mountaineer GoldLeaf Lines.</span></p><h2>Your Experience Aboard The Rocky Mountaineer GoldLeaf</h2><p>Two classes of service are available for the train; the SilverLeaf or the GoldLeaf experience.</p><p>These packages mainly differ by window size and dining access. The GoldLeaf service is equipped with a five-star restaurant, fresh, chef-prepared breakfast, and lunch, as well as afternoon wine and cheese.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-241568 alt="GoldLeaf Class Meal" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/golf-leaf-class-meal.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-241568 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>tipsfortravellers/Flickr</span><span class=caption-body>A typical GoldLeaf service meal.</span></p><p>There isn’t any wi-fi aboard the trains, so as to keep outside distractions to a minimum while the Rocky Mountains tower over you. Food, alcohol, and your hotel stay is all-inclusive in the price of your ticket.</p><p>While the SilverLeaf passengers also get huge windows, they don’t get to experience a fully domed, unobstructed view as with the GoldLeaf service. SilverLeaf passengers do, however, have access to an open-air platform. Stepping out into the crisp Canadian breeze seems like a nice way to stretch your legs for a few minutes.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-241566 alt="Banff National Park" width=640 height=480 data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/banff-national-park.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-241566 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>itapauline/Instagram</span><span class=caption-body>View of Moraine Lake in Banff National Park.</span></p><p>The GoldLeaf cars feature dimmable domed windows that utilize a suspended particle device layer.

Or to show you the engineering wonders that are the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spiral Tunnels</a>; which go under the Trans-Canada Highway, across the Kicking Horse River, into the Lower Spiral Tunnel in Mt.

They have jagged, ice-capped peaks. They’re dotted with alpine lakes and outdoor recreation sites.</p><p>Mount Robson in British Columbia is the highest peak in the mountain range and extends approximately 13,000 feet into the sky.</p>Some of the sights you’ll encounter on your journey with Rocky Mountaineer GoldLeaf service.<p>Banff and Jasper are two of the most popular destinations for visitors to Canada.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jasper National Park</a> is certainly glorious and these Canadian towns are connected by a highway that provides tourists with unobstructed mountain views from both sides.</p><p>Near Jasper is Athabasca Falls — the most powerful waterfall in the entirety of the Rockies.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-241570 alt="Kamloops Yard Mare" width=871 height=686 data-sizes="(max-width: 871px) 100vw, 871px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kamloops-yard-mare.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-241570 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>RockyMountaineer/Instagram</span><span class=caption-body>A mare munches on breakfast outside Kamloops.</span></p><p>Elk, deer, bighorn sheep, bald eagles, falcons, and osprey are some typical wildlife you may encounter on the way.</p>One guest of the Rocky Mountaineer GoldLeaf has a pretty great story to tell about the level of customer service the manager and hosts provided her.<p>If you’re lucky, you could catch a few wolverines, moose, or mountain goats. Not-so-typical sightings include the legendary Sasquatch. Indeed, the Rocky Mountaineer GoldLeaf’s website insists it <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is a possibility</a>.</p><p>Alas, this is just a sampling of the animals you can spot from a moving train. On the hiking trails, you’ll likely encounter porcupine, marmots, pika, and pine martens — similar to minks or otters.</p><p>The best times of year to observe wildlife — and thus perhaps to book your travels — are the spring, fall, and winter as most animals tend to stay at higher elevations during the summer.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-241574 alt="Rocky Mountaineer Train" width=600 height=800 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rocky-mountaineer-train.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-241574 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The train approaches a mountain range.</span></p><h2>The Future Of The Rocky Mountaineer GoldLeaf Lines</h2><p>The Rocky Mountaineer began as a once-weekly daytime rail service between Calgary and Vancouver in June of 1988.</p><p>Now, it’s the busiest privately-owned passenger rail service in North America.</p><p>The Rocky Mountaineer recently added four new train carriages to its fleet and another three are on the docket for 2020.
