He and his wife, <strong>Lauren Akins</strong>, are proud parents to Willa, Ada, Lennon and Lillie. The couple have shared their adoption journey with their massive fanbase and were overjoyed when they became parents.</p><p dir=ltr>Thomas and Lauren were childhood sweethearts who got married in a stunning Nashville ceremony in 2012. In 2017, the pair announced that they had adopted their first child together, Willa. Lauren was working with the 147 Million Orphans organization when she met then-2-year-old Willa in Uganda. She instantly knew that she wanted to bring her home.</p><p dir=ltr>“I had always wanted to adopt,” Lauren told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-linkindex=1>Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;in 2018. “My mom is actually adopted. I am a product of an adopted family. So, it has always been something that has been very natural for me.”</p><p dir=ltr>After meeting Willa, Lauren found out she was pregnant. Three months after bringing Willa home, the country stars’ wife gave birth to their second child, Ada, in August 2017. Thomas was beyond excited to welcome another baby girl into the family.</p><p dir=ltr>​​”I can’t believe that we have two daughters!” the Georgia native captioned his Instagram post after Ada’s birth. “My wife @laur_akins labored almost 36 hours. She is by far the strongest human being I have ever met and I have a newfound respect for moms around the world.”</p><p dir=ltr>There is no shortage of photos of their adorable family on social media. Both Willa and Ada even took part in ABC’s&nbsp;<i>Disney Family Singalong</i>&nbsp;with their dad in 2020. The four-time Grammy nominee featured his two older daughters in his popular 2018 music video for “Life Changes.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></b></p><p dir=ltr>As if life couldn’t get any sweeter for the couple, they announced the birth of their third daughter, Lennon, in February 2020. Lauren shared on Instagram that Willa and Ada “couldn’t be happier to finally get to kiss her little face.” Fans were shocked during Thomas’ concert in May 2021 when he announced that Lauren was pregnant&nbsp;with their fourth child.&nbsp;<b></b></p><p dir=ltr>“Well … we are pregnant again! Tonight when I was on stage in Fort Worth about to play ‘To the Guys That Date My Girls,’ my wife talked to me in my (ear monitors) and said ‘you can tell them if you want’ so anyways, now you know,” he wrote on Instagram following the show. “We are pumped to be having our 4th girl. Feel free to buy all the merch you want, knowing that all the proceeds are going straight to all these weddings I’ll be paying for one day! Love you so much @laur_akins we always wanted a big Thanksgiving table.”<b></b></p><p dir=ltr>Their fourth daughter, Lillie, was born on November 15, 2021. The couple proved to be superheroes as they began to navigate life with four children under the age of 6.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Scroll to meet Thomas and Lauren’s four beautiful daughters.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46tn6ilkah6s7TErausZZuesbR5zJ6crWWknbJur86upa2qqWLAta3RrGRtZZOdtq2w0Z6laA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
