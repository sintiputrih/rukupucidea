During the wide-ranging interview, Rogers had a lot of fascinating things to say about her life and career up until that point in her life.</p><p>Still, the most notable part of the discussion, as Fandom Wire quoted in a 2024 article, was when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rogers spoke about her divorce from Tom Cruise</a>. According to what Rogers told Playboy, <strong>her lack of bedroom activity with Cruise led to their divorce</strong>.</p><p>"Well, here's the real story. Tom was seriously thinking of becoming a monk. At least for that period of time, it looked as though marriage wouldn't fit into his overall spiritual need.

Instead, Rogers only made those remarks after Playboy asked her if<strong> </strong>she was the one who was done with Cruise.</p><p>Also during Mimi Rogers' 2001 Telegraph interview, she revealed what she hated most about the coverage of her marriage to Tom Cruise. "What did annoy me was the age thing. Every six months, [the press] seemed to add another year to my age.
