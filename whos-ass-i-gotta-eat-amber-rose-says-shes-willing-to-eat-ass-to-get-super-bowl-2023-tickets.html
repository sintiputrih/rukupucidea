Philadelphia Eagles defeated San Francisco 49ers 31-7 in the NFC Championship game. However, in the AFC Championship game, the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Bengals 23-20.</p><p>Super Bowl LVII will take place at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The Eagles will be honoured in the home locker room before their championship game versus the Chiefs. The Eagles are hoping for their second Super Bowl victory in team history.</p><h4><strong>The Eagles are the front runners to win this time among betters.</strong></h4><p>The Kansas City Chiefs are typically a fan favourite among casual bettors. But based on the point spread, it doesn’t look like that will be the case for Super Bowl LVII. The money has been slowly coming in on the Eagles ever since the point spread between the Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles for the Super Bowl was set.</p><p>It came as a bit of a surprise that the Chiefs were underdogs. In the Patrick Mahomes era, Kansas City rarely scores points. But according to our sources, since the Eagles have had a fantastic season, they have become a betting favourite since the beginning of the year.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong>PLAY: FREE ONLINE GAMES</strong></a></p><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href=# rel="external noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc sponsored" data-wpel-link=external><strong>Recommended: Sports Fan App</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrAsbvRraqgqpGeuW%2BvzqZmsKCfqHqiv9JmoGafn6nBonnEmqtmmZ2XsrN50aiqnmWjlsa0edKhnKxlp565rbXNoGStp12arrV5wKyqZqyfYrSmwIysrKmdomKvsMPLZmlpamNiwaqvyp6rrGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
