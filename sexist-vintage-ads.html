The advertisement is the glossy, pop cultural meeting point between supply and demand, where marketing pros make clear who they think is buying their product and for what reasons. And as these ads make apparent, marketers have drawn on just about anything to make potential customers' eyes stick.</p><p>The advertisements featured below demonstrate the great social strides we have made since their publication, but also highlight the thinking that has helped shape our culture for centuries.</p><p>From mustache trainers to whatever Chill's Tasteless Chill Tonic is, these vintage ads are sure to tickle you. I mean, you never know when you'll need a health jolting chair, which was marketed as a practical household substitute for the saddle horse.</p><p>While some of the ads are hilarious, others are insanely offensive such as the one for a pamphlet of secret Asian lovemaking tips. Some are even more distasteful than these <a href=#>sexist beer ads</a>. For example, could you imagine an ad featuring a wife being spanked today? Or one that showed a man mocking a wife for ruining dinner?</p><p>Companies such as Ben-Gay and 7-Up even dabbled in the business of misinformed and strange ads. But hey, they must have done something right to stick around this long. I mean at least they're not <a href=#>cocaine drops</a>.</p><p>Here are thirty-five of the most bizarre items we've come across.</p><p>Enjoyed these sexist vintage ads? Be sure to check out <a href=#>black and white photos restored in brilliant color</a> and <a href=#>ingeniously creative ads that will make you think twice</a>.
