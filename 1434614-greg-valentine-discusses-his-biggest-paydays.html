Some of the top talents the former WWF Intercontinental Champion has competed against are WWE Hall of Famers such as <a href=#>Hollywood Hulk Hogan</a>, The Ultimate Warrior, Macho Man Randy Savage, <a href=#>Jake ‘The Snake’ Roberts</a>, and many more.</p><p>Recently, during an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wrestling Shoot Interviews</a>, the WWE Hall of Famer revealed the matches from which he got a hefty salary. He stated that wrestling stars such as Hogan and Warrior would automatically result in a good payday.</p><p>“Well, you could wrestle Andre The Giant. You could wrestle Ultimate Warrior. They took care of me when I wrestled Ronnie Garvin… Because we were like… Open the card. You didn’t have to be all the way in the top but… Back in the day in the 90s if you worked with Hogan or Warrior or Jake ‘The Snake’ [Roberts] or any of these top stars, you gotta good payday. He took care of me and ‘Rugged’ Ronnie Garvin, Valentine Beefcake against the Bulldogs… We would be main event by ourselves, usually, it was just a single on the top. But they sent Hogan somewhere. We did some Beefcake and Valentine with a Bulldog. He sold out everywhere,” Greg Valentine said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaJ2mmru1e9awnGhpZGiBd32TZp6rnZdiw6K4xKeroqaVYrGqv8Kuqqydo2K1qr%2BMm6Cgn5WowW68wLKbmrGj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
