He cites the deaths of Nipsey Hussle and Juice WRLD, as well as the passing of his grandmother in 2018. Of that loss, he <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://variety.com/2020/music/news/lil-nas-x-grammys-old-town-road-1203469735/>said</a>,</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>“She was the first person close to me who died. It was devastating. And it made me a hypochondriac: I’d wake up, heart racing. It was scary.”</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Lil Nas X said he began to self-medicate after to cope with the struggle of his loss. This included smoking marijuana heavily.</p><h3 style=text-align:center class=ah><strong class=Ug>LOSING HIS CONFIDENCE</strong></h3><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>At the height of his booming career, <a class="ae -U" href=#>Lil Nas X</a> bravely came out as gay. But this didn’t do much to boost his morale. Back in September, he took a step back by canceling a couple of shows. He now admits it was due to his lack of confidence.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>“I would start to overthink it all and I’d get overwhelmed."</p><h3 style=text-align:center class=ah><strong class=Ug>THE STRUGGLES IN HIS FAMILY LIFE</strong></h3><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>But Lil Nas X’s problems weren’t entirely about his personal struggles.

As opposed to his father, Lil Nas X barely spoke about his mother.

He was only five when they split up and was made to live with his grandmother. At nine years old, he began living with his father who gained custody of him.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>To this day, Lil Nas X remains close to his dad who has learned to embrace his sexuality. He admits they’re still at an adjustment period and thinks it too soon to introduce any man. But they’re closer now because he was honest.</p>Read also<a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>Is Wayne Brady Gay?

His co-manager, Adam Leber says there’s pressure because his client is a perfectionist who won’t complete an album because of a timeline. Each song has to be good and there should be no fillers.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>The second album is always harder because there’s pressure to outdo the first.
