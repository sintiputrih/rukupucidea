Recently, it was speculated that Travis Kelce will be joining <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Taylor Swift</a> in Argentina to show his support. Several reports suggested that Kelce would travel south of the equator to cheer Swift during her performances in Buenos Aires. But again, the TE’s recent spotting at Mahomes’ noble project in Kansas City says otherwise.</p><p>Patrick Mahomes hosted their fourth annual foundation gala on Thursday in Kansas City, which was attended by Kelce, and some key players from the squad. The 15 and Mahomies’ Instagram story reflected that&nbsp; Kelce missed the first night of the pop star’s Eras tour amid his commitments back in Kansas City. However, a sweet and generous donation from her speaks verses about her supportive nature.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Taylor Swift remains supportive of the cause!&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Travis Kelce did not make it to the last leg of Taylor Swift’s Eras tour in Argentina yet. Well, it’s because he had a noble reason not to. Travis Kelce was instead spotted in Kansas City attending Patrick Mahomes’ 15 and The Mahomes Foundation Gala on Thursday. The pictures were shared on &nbsp;<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>15 and the Mahomies’ Instagram story.</a> with the caption “@killatrav in the building”. Kelce was praised at the Gala for his efforts. However, his absence in Argentina was taken positively by his rumored girlfriend, who seemingly decided to donate something of her own to the Gala, literally, something of her own!</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-nba-active-basketball-news-with-luka-doncic-and-wife-jessica-olsson-in-stands-dirk-nowitzki-takes-on-ex-teammate-in-an-entirely-different-set-up-pickle-ball-jason-kidd?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Luka-Doncic-and-Dirk-Nowitzki-473x315.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">With Luka Doncic and Wife Jessica Olsson in Stands, Dirk Nowitzki Takes on ex-Teammate in an Entirely Different Set-up</p></a><p>Since she could not make it to the Charity Gala for obvious reasons, MLFootball shared a post on Twitter stating that she donated signed memorabilia to the charity. The value of this donation is not known, but coming from Taylor Swift, it would hold a lot of value. But again, the wholesome gesture has taken Swifties by storm as they gather in Buenos Aires to pay their respects and watch her perform.</p><p>The latest report by ET suggested that Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce was headed south of the equator to cheer up for Swift. While the athlete’s presence in Kansas City speaks otherwise, the Chiefs’ ongoing Bye Week still leaves scope for some hope among fans.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>The plans that didn’t come through</strong></h2><p>The <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Kansas City Chiefs</a> have a bye week coming up. The squad is playing against the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Philadelphia Eagles</a> on 20th November. Obviously, the brothers had to talk about it on their podcast. <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Jason Kelce</a> asked his brother about his plans for the bye week. The TE mentioned that he might go somewhere in the South, “close to the equator” to have a chill time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Luka-Doncic-and-Dirk-Nowitzki-473x315.jpeg><p>The latest report by ET also suggested that he would be visiting Argentina among the 80,000 fans that plan to show up there. However, Kelce’s recent spotting in Kansas City is a moment of mixed feelings since the TE chose to support his teammate and dear friend, Patrick Mahomes for a noble cause.</p><p>Swift’s international Eras tour dates kicked off on Thursday in Buenos Aires and would continue for three nights before she heads to Rio de Janeiro on the 17th of November. Since the Chiefs’ are on their Bye Week, it still frees Travis Kelce’s schedule. Who knows what surprise awaits ahead? What do you think about the whole situation?
