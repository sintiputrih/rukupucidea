And yet, Redditors are still struggling to reconcile with the ones that got away, leading them to pay respects to the fallen failed franchises they desperately needed to see more from.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true><a href=#>In the age of sequels, what are some movies that you believe deserved a sequel but didn’t actually get one?(or even a 3rd movie to complete a trilogy)</a> from <a href=#>movies</a></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/23_Jump_Street_cover-e1653578982447.jpg><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=733 data-injectable=true>Shane Black’s The Nice Guys <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">always tends to come up when this conversation rears its head</a>, as does Guy Ritchie’s The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Unfortunately, both of them bombed in spite of winning widespread praise, and folks evidently aren’t over it just yet. Similarly, the latest chapter in the phenomenal Jump Street saga remains lodged in development hell, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and the same goes for Jason Statham’s bonkers Crank</a>.</p><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=false>One of the more surprising mentions finds a large number of users agreeing that Ridley Scott should finish off the trilogy he began with Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, even if Disney’s acquisition of Fox looks to have permanently nipped that one in the bud. Too many franchises have gone on for way longer than they should, but just as many didn’t get the opportunity to thrive that they deserved.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonauZnpi1qr%2FEZp2appGptqS%2FjKWYpp2eqXq1tMRmaaecXZa7pXmSq5tmoZ6owaK4y6acp6yjYsGpsdhmpZ6dlJqxbsDOZqqenV2XwrV5zZ6tnqpdnLy1ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
