Mixing funk density with the weightlessness of a blown kiss, Rodgers’s rhythm guitar in “Get Lucky” and a couple other standouts is a shameless reproduction of early Chic.

Surely you don’t need an introduction to this, but in terms of Daft Punk, listen back to its restraint; for all the expansive disco swoon, <i>Off the Wall</i> is a sharp, lithe, focused affair as notable for what it avoids as for what it adds.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-2729ecd8d0baf9af155853286355d95b-10-0-0@published data-word-count=4>Listen: “<a href=#>Off the Wall</a>”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-2729ecd8d0baf9af155853286355d95b-11-0-0@published data-word-count=73><b>5.

To follow their mega-popular mega-hit <i>Rumours</i>, the band burned through a big budget — <i>Tusk </i>is often called the first million-dollar record — and wound up with a double album that is defiantly diverse, strategically uneven, and, in ways that have aged well over time, deliriously weird.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-2729ecd8d0baf9af155853286355d95b-16-0-0@published data-word-count=2>Listen: “<a href=#>Tusk</a>”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-2729ecd8d0baf9af155853286355d95b-17-0-0@published data-word-count=113><strong>8.&nbsp;</strong><b>Paul Williams, <i>Just an Old Fashioned Love Song</i> (A&M, 1971)</b><br>In a move equivalent to Quentin Tarantino exhuming erstwhile stars from the dustbin of cinema history, Daft Punk dug pretty deep to enlist Paul Williams and his enchanted voice for the stirring <i>RAM</i> song “Touch.” An oddball of a sort that seems possible only in the sixties and seventies, Williams wrote songs that became hits in other acts’ hands (see the Carpenters’ “We’ve Only Just Begun” and Three Dog Night’s “An Old Fashioned Love Song,” among others).

Williams wrote the song with collaborator Kenneth Ascher for Jim Henson to give voice to, and the shatteringly moving result in the first <i>Muppet Movie</i> took on a life that nobody could have foreseen.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-2729ecd8d0baf9af155853286355d95b-20-0-0@published data-word-count=109>Listen: “<a href=#>The Rainbow Connection</a>”</p><p><b>10.

If it’s the former (as it has to be, at least to some extent), they fall in line with the curious character Doug Randle. In inimitable seventies folk-rock fashion, <i>Songs for the New Industrial State</i> delivers a wry, deadpan, and very slyly playful critique of the madness of a modern world populated with abundant colored plastic things and people zoned-out behind their unblinking chemical stares.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-2729ecd8d0baf9af155853286355d95b-21-0-0@published data-word-count=3>Listen: “<a href=#>Coloured Plastics</a>”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-2729ecd8d0baf9af155853286355d95b-22-0-0@published data-word-count=72><b>11.

Vannier made his name with arrangements for Serge Gainsbourg (see the skeevy classic <i>Melody Nelson</i>), but he laid it all out on his own first solo album <i>L’enfant Assassin des Mouches</i>, an exotic, all-over-the-map suite of songs somehow about a child killing flies.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-2729ecd8d0baf9af155853286355d95b-23-0-0@published data-word-count=6>Listen: “<a href=#>Les Gardes Volent Au Secours</a>”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-2729ecd8d0baf9af155853286355d95b-24-0-0@published data-word-count=76><b>12.

It’s like yacht rock haunted by specters in sailors’ caps (maybe even Charles Manson, with whom Wilson hung out a bit in the early pre-murder days).

Air, <i>10,000 Hz Legend</i> (Astralwerks, 2001)</b><br>After making a name for themselves with a comely sort of cosmopolitan lounge-pop, the two Frenchmen in Air spaced-out in a serious way on <i>10,000 Hz Legend</i>. Long, laconic, and more than a little bit puzzling, the songs split between affecting mood pieces and deceptively affectless moans that work well to make the good parts all the better.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-2729ecd8d0baf9af155853286355d95b-47-0-0@published data-word-count=4>Listen: “<a href=#>Sex Born Poison</a>”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-2729ecd8d0baf9af155853286355d95b-48-0-0@published data-word-count=80><b>24. N.E.R.D., <i>In Search of …</i> (Virgin, 2001)<br></b>At the height of their stardom as hip-hop and R&B producers, the Neptunes (including Pharrell Williams, Daft Punk’s go-to vocalizer for two new songs) banded together for these funked-up takes on what Steely Dan might have sounded like if they’d grown up in Virginia Beach and listened to Timbaland.

Panda Bear, <i>Person Pitch</i> (Paw Tracks, 2007)</b><br>The comparatively warm and cuddly one in Animal Collective makes a surprise appearance as a Daft Punk mouthpiece in “Doin’ It Right,” a heartening and decidedly human ode near the new album’s end. Fans of that — a sort of chant delivered with a mix of innocence and ritualistic devotion — will find much to commune with in this solo album, which takes a loop-based approach to crafting songs into the form of cozy blankets.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-2729ecd8d0baf9af155853286355d95b-53-0-0@published data-word-count=4>Listen: “<a href=#>Comfy in Nautica</a>”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-2729ecd8d0baf9af155853286355d95b-54-0-0@published data-word-count=70><b>27.

(Tip to aspiring hit-makers: it never hurts to have your song coupled with the image of Ryan Gosling looking stoic and cool.)
