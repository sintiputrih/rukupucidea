We always support grabbing cute new activewear and a reusable water bottle, but if you’re truly going to stay motivated to use that gym membership, we need to make sure your body is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">up for the challenge</a>.</p><p>Many people find success using <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pre-workouts</a>, which are supplements known to help enhance your athletic performance while also improving your recovery. There are many options out there, but let’s stick with a number one bestseller, shall we? This one is even 40% off right now!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">C4 Sport Pre-Workout Powder</a> (originally $25) for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$15</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, January 2, 2024, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>Adding <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this pre-workout</a> to your gym routine could lead to:</p><ul><li>Elevated energy: You’ll find 135 mg of caffeine in the formula to give you that explosive boost you need to get through longer, harder workouts. Shoppers <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">assure</a> that it “provides just the right kick of energy without the jittery feeling”!</li><li>Muscular endurance: The CarnoSyn Beta-Alanine in this supplement may support muscles and combat muscular fatigue, meaning you can stay more motivated and take fewer breaks for a more rewarding workout.</li><li>Supported hydration: This pre-workout features electrolytes to replenish key minerals lost during high-intensity, sweaty workouts. If you’re dehydrated, your workout and wellness game will fall flat, fast!</li></ul><p>C4 has sold over two billion servings of this zero-sugar powder since 2011. There are 30 servings per container, and each is only five calories. You can see why pro athletes like NFL stars <strong>CJ Stroud</strong> and <strong>Bijan Robinson</strong> use it!</p><p>One Amazon reviewer <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a> that they felt as though they had “enough energy to outrun <strong>Usain Bolt</strong>” after taking <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this pre-workout</a>, and that they walked into their gym “feeling like <strong>The Rock</strong>.” That’s major!</p><p>One extremely important aspect to us is that this pre-workout is tested by third parties, meaning we can trust what’s inside. It’s <a href=# rel=noopener>NSF Certified for Sport</a>, an independent certification program recognized by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League and the Canadian Football League.</p><p>This supplement comes in three flavors: watermelon, blue raspberry and fruit punch. Just mix one scoop with a glass of water 20-30 minutes before your workout for best results. This is going to be a game-changer!</p><p><strong>Looking for more?
