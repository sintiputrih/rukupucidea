Gordon Ramsay is getting roasted after an old clip from The F Word resurfaced, in which the chef was told he couldn’t properly cook pad Thai.
A Twitter user shared the 30-second clip earlier this week, which is from a 2009 episode of the British series. In the episode, Ramsay was set to visit the Wimbledon Thai temple in London to cook for Buddhist monks. He stopped by the Blue Elephant restaurant, where head chef Chang was to help him learn how to prepare Thailand’s traditional stir-fried rice noodle dish."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Before you call it pad Thai I have to taste it first,” Chang said, taking a bite and immediately looking disappointed by the TV personality’s cooking.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>YALL IM CRYINGGGGGGGGGG <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/SzTb0kkZYz</a></p><p>— Sydnee W.

Look at that face.”</p><p>“This is not pad Thai at all, no. Pad Thai has to be sweet, sour and salty,” Chang responded.</p><p>“I think that doesn’t taste too bad,” Ramsay said defending his dish, “It’s not perfect.”</p><p>Chang then cut in, saying: “For you, but not for me.”</p><p>People have been reacting to the clip with their own take on the interaction between the two chefs. “My parents used to look at me this way,” one <a href=#>Twitter user wrote</a> in reference to Chang’s facial expression.
