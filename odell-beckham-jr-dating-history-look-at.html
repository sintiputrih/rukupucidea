"I am like, 'can my vagina [get] a rest,'" she told <a href=#>The Jasmine Brand</a> in 2017. "Odell is literally one of my best friends in the entire world. We are very very close, very tight, we talk a lot." The TV personality also debunked rumors surrounding OBJ's sexuality, telling the outlet she is "150% percent sure he is not gay!"</p><p dir=ltr>Around the same time the wide receiver was linked to Rose, Beckham Jr. was papped getting flirty with Khloé Kardashian. In 2016, <a href=#>TMZ</a> published photos of the two at Drake's Memorial Day pool bash, showing Kardashian all but sitting on Beckham Jr.'s lap. He later dismissed the snaps as being taken "out of context," according to&nbsp;<a href=#>Life & Style</a>. The "Good American" founder seemingly responded on X, formerly known as Twitter, <a href=#>writing</a>, "It's really not that deep."</p><p dir=ltr>After Kardashian, there was Zendaya, whom OBJ snuggled up to a Grammys afterparty in 2016. But like Kardashian and Rose before her, Zendaya insisted she and Beckham Jr. were just "homies," according to <a href=#>Page Six</a>. Although they were later spotted sitting courtside at a basketball game, whatever was going on between the two quickly fizzled out. Beckham Jr. also made headlines for a brief dalliance with model Polyxeni Ferfeli in 2017, but the consensus here is that the footballer was just playing the field.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxga4J1go6om56knGKvpq%2FKoZimZZqneqWt06KloGWYnsC1u9GyZKWnn6B6osCO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
