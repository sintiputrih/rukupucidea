The Reign are the No. 6 seed of the NWSL – the last postseason birth – and just a point behind the Spirit – the No. 5 ranked team. They could be in serious danger of missing the playoffs if they lose against both, or either, Washington and Chicago.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Rapinoe will be hoping to win her last home game with her club after her time with the U.S. women’s national team ended abruptly in August. The forward was among three U.S. players to have missed a penalty kick in a Round of 16 loss to Sweden – the team’s worst-ever finish at the tournament in history.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Hey Megan! It’s Billie Jean [King],’ said the 12-time Grand Slam winner in a tribute video for Rapinoe shown prior to kick-off on Friday. ‘You’re a legend and a leader! And we’re looking forward to the next part of your journey.’&nbsp;</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async id=i-5333f15aebfa7193 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/07/02/76268701-0-image-a-7_1696642989363.jpg height=425 width=634 alt="Megan Rapinoe was honored prior to her last home game for the OL Reign in Seattle on Friday" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p></p><p class=imageCaption>Megan Rapinoe was honored prior to her last home game for the OL Reign in Seattle on Friday</p><img decoding=async id=i-ccd399872e5a71c2 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/07/02/76268695-0-image-a-3_1696642897465.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Fans honored Rapinoe by wearing pink hair wigs and setting a NWSL attendance record (33k)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p></p><p class=imageCaption>Fans honored Rapinoe by wearing pink hair wigs and setting a NWSL attendance record (33k)</p><img decoding=async id=i-bbdef081948c37fb src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/07/02/76268709-0-image-m-6_1696642917967.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Rapinoe&nbsp;warms up before her last regular-season home game against the Washington Spirit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><p class=imageCaption>Rapinoe&nbsp;warms up before her last regular-season home game against the Washington Spirit</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>”Pinoe, what can I say…you did it all!’ then said Abby Wambach – the highest all-time goal scorer in U.S. women’s national team history. ‘You were a part of the biggest games, biggest moments.
