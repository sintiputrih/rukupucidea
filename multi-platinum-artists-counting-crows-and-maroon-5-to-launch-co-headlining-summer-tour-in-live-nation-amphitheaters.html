On April 9th, Maroon 5 will perform on the star-studded Fox television/”American Idol” charity show, “Idol Gives Back,” to be followed by an April 13th performance on Comedy Central’s live event benefiting autism, “Night Of Too Many Stars.”</p><p>Fresh off of the uber successful release of their highly anticipated new double album Saturday Nights & Sunday Mornings, Counting Crows will continue to win over fans with hits like the top 5 track “Mr. Jones,” “Hard Candy,” “Rain King” and others as well as hot new tracks like “You Can’t Count on Me,” “Washington Square” and “Cowboys.” Their new album, produced by Gil Norton & Brian Deck takes the listener on a journey through the frenetic, crazy, whirlwind, partying, famous Saturday Nights, and the redemptive, regretful aftermath of the Sunday Mornings that follow. But Counting Crows is one of those bands you follow for the long haul. For those that first heard them opening for Bob Dylan long ago, or subbing for Van Morrison one memorable night at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, much of the soundtrack of our times comes from the Crows — from their vivid musical landscapes as well as the feverish brilliance of singer/songwriter Adam Duritz.</p><p>“Counting Crows and Maroon 5 on the same stage is an incredible double bill for music fans,” said Live Nation’s Senior Vice President of Arena and Amphitheater Programming, Ryan McElrath. “Both bands have a huge body of hit songs that are sure to please fans from coast to coast.” The tour, which is expected to make more than 40 stops in all, is being produced by Live Nation and is a continuation of the long term touring deal the company struck with Maroon 5 in 2007 which runs through the summer of this year.</p><p>In the nine months since Sara Bareilles released her debut album, Little Voice, she has emerged as one of the most exciting breakthrough artists of 2008. Her hit single “Love Song” currently sits at #2 on the Top 40 charts and “Little Voice” has been certified gold.</p><p>Augustana are currently planning to release a new album titled “Can’t Love, Can’t Hurt” on April 29, 2008. The first single from the album is titled “Sweet and Low.”</p><p>The bands will be working with Reverb, an environmental non-profit, to make the tour green and educate and engage fans to promote environmental sustainability. The environmental efforts on the tour will include using biodiesel in all truck and buses, as well as neutralizing CO2 emissions from venue energy use, hotels, flights, touring vehicles, and fan travel.</p><p>In addition, backstage plastic, aluminum, paper and cardboard waste will be reduced and recycled. They’ll also be using biodegradable and reusable catering products along with local and organic food. A fan outreach Eco-Village will be set up at each show consisting of local environmental groups, green technologies, and a fan carbon offset program. Reverb will also be creating a dedicated Tour greening website including eco tips and a carpooling program.</p><p>About Maroon 5:</p><p>The quintet (vocalist/guitarist Adam Levine, guitarist James Valentine, keyboardist Jesse Carmichael, bassist Mickey Madden and drummer Matt Flynn) recently added to their gold reserves with a Grammy win for “Best Pop Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocals” for their blockbuster hit “Makes Me Wonder.” The chart-topping single was the lead track from the band’s multiplatinum-selling new album It Won’t Be Soon Before Long, which entered Billboard’s Top 200 Albums Chart at No. 1. In addition, “Makes Me Wonder,” its companion video and the album all consecutively hit No. 1 on iTunes sales charts. “Makes Me Wonder” also made history with the highest leap ever on the Billboard Hot 100 chart when it jumped from No. 64 to No. 1. The award marks Maroon 5’s third Grammy win, having taken home the gold for “Best New Artist” in 2005 and “Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal” in 2006. It Won’t Be Soon Before Long is the follow-up to the band’s hugely successful debut, Songs About Jane, which sold more than 10 million albums worldwide, has reached gold or platinum status in over 35 countries and yielded four chart-topping smash hit singles: “This Love,” “She Will Be Loved,” “Harder To Breathe” and “Sunday Morning.”</p><p>About Counting Crows:</p><p>Counting Crows hail from the San Francisco Bay area and consist of Adam Duritz (vocals), David Bryson (guitar), Charles Gillingham (keyboards), Dan Vickrey (guitar), Jim Bogios (drums), David Immergluck (guitar) and touring bassist Millard Powers. Counting Crows’ success dates back to their 1993 debut release August And Everything After and the hit single “Mr. Jones.” The band’s most recent success included a # 1 hit with the song “Accidentally In Love,” which was featured on the Shrek 2 soundtrack, as well as nominations in 2005 for a Grammy Award, a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award for the track. In 2004 the band released their first ever “Best Of” set Films About Ghosts which featured songs from every phase of the Counting Crow’s recording career and in 2006 a live record was released, New Amsterdam: Live at Heineken Music Hall 2003, while the band ventured out on a summer tour. Counting Crows has sold over 20 million records worldwide.</p><pre id=pre1 class=pre> Tour dates are as follows: Date Venue City Maroon 5, Counting Crows &amp; Sara Bareilles 7/25 Verizon Wireless Virginia Beach Amphitheater Virginia Beach, VA* 7/26 Toyota Pavilion at Montage Mountain Scranton, PA* 7/28 Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre Charlotte Charlotte, NC* 7/29 Time Warner Cable Music Pavilion at Walnut Creek Raleigh, NC* 7/31 Nikon at Jones Beach Theater Wantagh, NY* 8/2 Tweeter Center for the Performing Arts Boston, MA* 8/5 Hersheypark Stadium &amp; Star Pavilion Hershey, PA* 8/7 PNC Bank Arts Center Holmdel, NJ* 8/9 Susquehanna Bank Center Camden, NJ* 8/12 Saratoga Performing Arts Center Saratoga Springs, NY* 8/13 Bethel Woods Center for The Arts Bethel, NY* 8/15 New England Dodge Music Center Hartford, CT* 8/16 Nissan Pavilion Washington, DC* 8/18 Darien Lake Performing Arts Center Buffalo, NY* 8/19 Molson Amphitheatre Toronto, ON* 8/21 Post-Gazette Pavilion Pittsburgh, PA* 8/22 First Midwest Bank Amphitheatre Chicago, IL* 8/23 Marcus Amphitheater Milwaukee, WI* 8/26 Blossom Music Center Cleveland, OH* 8/28 Verizon Wireless Music Center Indianapolis Indianapolis, IN+ 8/29 DTE Energy Music Theatre Detroit, MI+ 8/30 Riverbend Music Center Cincinnati, OH+ 9/5 Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion Houston, TX+ 9/6 Superpages.com Center Dallas, TX+ 9/9 Journal Pavilion Albuquerque, NM+ 9/10 Cricket Wireless Pavilion Phoenix, AZ+ 9/12 Verizon Wireless Amphitheater Irvine, CA+ 9/13 Coors Amphitheatre San Diego, CA+ 9/17 Shoreline Amphitheatre at Mountain View Mountain View, CA+ 9/18 Sleep Train Pavilion Concord, CA+ 9/20 Amphitheater at Clark County Ridgefield, WA+ 9/21 White River Amphitheatre Seattle, WA+ 9/24 Coors Amphitheatre at Fiddler's Green Denver, CO+ 9/26 Starlight Theatre Kansas City, MO+ 9/27 Verizon Wireless Amphitheater St. Louis St. Louis, MO+ 9/30 Verizon Wireless Music Center Birmingham Birmingham, AL+ 10/1 Lakewood Amphitheatre Atlanta, GA+ 10/3 Ford Amphitheatre Tampa, FL+ 10/4 Cruzan Amphitheatre W.
