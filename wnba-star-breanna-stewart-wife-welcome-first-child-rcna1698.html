She was clearly ecstatic about the win — posting, “Got that gold!” on Instagram, along with an image of her biting her medal.</p><p>But that victory paled next to Ruby’s arrival, which Stewart told People “has been the best part of 2021 and easily one of the best moments of my life.”&nbsp;</p><p>The Olympics weren’t completely out of her thoughts, though: She had considered giving Ruby the middle name “Tokyo,” but Xargay quickly ruled it out.</p><p>“First of all we don’t use middle names in Spain,” Xargay said in a video documentary produced by Bleacher Report and TOGETHXR. “And you’re gonna call her Ruby Tokyo? That doesn’t go together.”</p><p>Xargay and Stewart announced their engagement in May and got married in July. But they kept their plans for starting a family quiet, even from some friends and family. In the documentary, Stewart’s mom and dad seem genuinely stunned by the news.</p><p>“People are definitely going to be shocked,” Stewart said<strong> </strong>in a clip. “We kept this a secret for, like, 40 weeks.”</p><p>The couple started dating in April 2019, the same night Stewart tore her Achilles’ tendon.</p><p>“Me being injured was a blessing in disguise,” Stewart said. “Those moments and memories were huge for blossoming our relationship into what it is.”</p><p>Unable to play, Stewart made the decision to freeze her eggs.</p><p>“I really didn’t know why I was doing it, If I’m being honest,” she said in the video. “It was just that I was injured, I can’t play. … When else am I going to get a two-week period when I’m not playing?”</p><p>In retrospect, though, “it was probably one of the best decisions I’ve ever made in my life,” she said, “because you’re setting yourself up for the future.”</p><p>Stewart said she had always wanted to have a family, but her career made that difficult.</p><p>“As a women’s basketball player, it’s like, ‘OK, how do you do that? How do you plan that perfectly so the baby comes during the summer?’” she said in a clip. “And now, after the Olympics for 2021? Because we’re cutting it a little close.”</p><p>Working with a surrogate was the obvious solution. “Why can’t I be the best player and have a baby?” Stewart said. “Why can’t we do both?”</p><p>She and Xargay were together at the WNBA bubble in Bradenton, Florida, for the 2020 season. In July 2021, Xargay <a href=#>announced her retirement</a> from basketball.</p><p>“Goodbye, but you will always be in my memories and I will always treasure the memories that I created with you,” she <a href=#>wrote in a July 15 Instagram post</a>.</p><p>On Monday, <a href=#>Xargay posted</a>, “The best part of this year has been becoming a mother and growing a family with my incredible wife, @breannastewart30.”</p><p>In the video, Stewart said she hopes their story shows people “there’s no perfect way to find love, have a family or create a family.”</p><p>“Becoming a mom is bigger than anything else that I’ve done,” she said, “and I look forward to every beautiful and challenging moment as a family of three.”</p><p class=endmark><strong>Follow&nbsp;</strong><a href=#><strong>NBC Out</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;on&nbsp;</strong><a href=#><strong>Twitter</strong></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong><a href=#><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;&&nbsp;</strong><a href=#><strong>Instagram</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r67Cp5ywq16YvK57zZuaZqelqXywwdNmo6KelWKur7CMrKuypJVkxK%2BuwGaqrZmiYq%2BzscCnpZplo6myuK3RrWSwoZaaerixy5ympp1dm7azv9NmmqGhnJl6s6%2FNmmhvcWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
