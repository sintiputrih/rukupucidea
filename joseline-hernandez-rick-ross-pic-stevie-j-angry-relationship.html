When Rick appeared on The Wendy Williams Show on March 23, she asked him if they hooked up. Although Rick denied it, he took a very long pause, turned his head and shielded his face before answering. And, he even looked at the photo and salaciously said, “It felt right at the moment."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And, he even looked at the photo and salaciously said, “It felt right at the moment.” So, clearly he must be attracted to Joseline, right? Well, “the way <span class=il>Rick&nbsp;</span>answered Wendy’s question just fanned the flames for Stevie,” our source said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><span class=il>Although “Stevie</span>‘s forgiven <span class=il>Joseline</span>,” the source said that he’s not letting Rick off that easy. In fact, “he wants <span class=il>Rick</span> to keep Joseline’s name out of his mouth — end of story. He should have more respect for <span class=il>Stevie</span> than he’s been showing.” This may get ugly..</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>When the photo first released in Jan. 2016, Stevie J went nuts! He was not happy to say the least. Then, Joseline ended up getting pregnant with his child just months later, so you know tensions had to be at an all time high. Regardless of Stevie and Joseline’s involvement it always seemed like Rick was always&nbsp;a mystery since the scandalous photo, where he felt her up, made waves.</p><h3><a href=#>Rick Ross — See Pics Of The Rapper</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-8>Stevie and Joseline were on and off all throughout 2016… well, mostly off. They even got into a nasty custody battle before their daughter, <strong>Bonnie Bella&nbsp;</strong>, 4 months, was born on Dec. 28, 2016. While their trials and tribulations are currently playing out on the sixth season of Love & Hip Hop Atlanta, it seems to be a different story on social media.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Just when we thought they were on terrible terms, Joseline and Stevie sparked rumors that they had reconciled in Feb. 2017. The two kept posting adorable photos together that made them look like they squashed their 2016 beef, which included a few phone calls to the police. They were even spotted out together as recent as March 13. So, what’s really going on here? We’ll have to see it all play out every Monday when L&HHATL airs on Vh1!</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you think Rick and Joseline hooked up?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlnZH10e5FtZqOno5q5qrrEZp%2Beqp6Wu6Wx2WapopubYr%2Bwv9Jmp6KbXajBpsLInmSjZZGjtLPFjKucpZmknryvv8eip2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
