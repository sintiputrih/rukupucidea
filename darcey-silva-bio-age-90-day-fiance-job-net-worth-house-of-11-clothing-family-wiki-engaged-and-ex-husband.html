Stacey even&nbsp;joined Darcey on&nbsp;<strong>Pillow Talk</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;TLC’s popular spinoff</strong> series which features stars from earlier seasons of the show who relax in bed with their loved ones and dissect the newest installments of&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé.</p><p>On tonight’s episode of the show, Darcey and British boyfriend <strong>Tom</strong> travel to Albania to meet up with Stacey, who is dating a man from Albania named Florian Sukaj; however, Tom is slightly put off by Darcey’s “twin dynamic,” according to&nbsp;TLC’s episode description,&nbsp;and his first impression of Stacey isn’t very good.</p><p>As mentioned above, the twins have appeared together on episodes of&nbsp;Pillow Talk,&nbsp;where they invited viewers into their homes to watch the newest episodes of&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After.&nbsp;The ladies were a big hit on the show and kept fans on their toes with hilarious commentary and witty remarks as they&nbsp;reacted to the drama and added their own thoughts on the featured couples.</p><p>The reality stars also recently launched a career in music as the Silva Twins, debuting their first song titled “Lock Your Number” on Spotify last year. The dynamic duo described the song on&nbsp;CD Baby&nbsp;as a&nbsp;“fun dance song which has a very catchy, memorable hook that everyone can relate to.” Check out the song below:</p><p>The twins are very close, and Darcey hold’s Stacey’s approval in high esteem when it comes to the men she dates. Stacey didn’t approve of&nbsp;Darcey’s ex-fiance Jesse Meester, so she is hoping her sister likes Tom.</p><p>“Stacey always told me Jesse was bad for me,” Darcey says on tonight’s episode of the show. “I just didn’t listen.” However, it looks like Tom’s first impression of Stacey isn’t very good, according to&nbsp;Soap Dirt; read on to find out why.</p><p>Spoilers for tonight’s episode of the show reveal that Tom isn’t terribly impressed with Stacey after flying to Albania to meet his girlfriend’s twin sister.&nbsp;90 Day Fiance: Before the 90 Days&nbsp;spoilers show Darcey and Tom flying to Tirana, Albania to meet Stacey. However, Stacey shows up late to their meeting, which Tom isn’t too happy about.</p><p>“I don’t like waiting for anyone, really. 15 minutes goes by, becomes 20, 25,” Tom says, according to Soap Dirt. “And it’s supposed to be like an introduction to the family. It’s not getting off to a good start”.</p><p>As Tom gets more put off by their late arrival, Darcey continues to text Stacey, to no avail. Soap Dirt reports that Tom finally gives Stacey and Florian an ultimatum – arrive in fifteen minutes or he’s gone, so it definitely looks like their first meeting isn’t off to a great start.</p><p>According to another article by Soap Dirt, Darcey and Stacey are currently in a heated argument over Stacey’s Albanian boyfriend Florian, who Darcey believes is using Stacey. The publication reports that Darcey implied that her twin has been begging her to help sponsor Florian, an Albanian model and Stacey’s boyfriend of four years, so she can bring him back to the U.S. Darcey apparently refused to help because she believes Florian is using her twin for money and his green card.</p><p>Soap Dirt also reports that Darcey doesn’t believe Florian will be a good step-father or provider for her nephews, according to an Instagram post. Darcey added that Stacey needs to “figure it out on her own” and not depend on her and their family for help sponsoring him. “I will not condone my sister to try to repeatedly convince me to help,” she insisted. “I will not do that as a sister.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=darcey-silva-and-jesse></span><span>Darcey Silva and Jesse</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Jesse</strong> opened up about his explosive relationship and notorious breakup with Darcey. And he certainly didn’t hold back about their tumultuous time together. On his last night in Amsterdam before a three-month trip to New York, Jesse looked back at his tumultuous relationship with Darcey.</p><p>“Our relationship was a disaster,” Jesse declared. “But I’m very grateful for it because I now know what I do not want. I’m just really sure how important it is to have someone authentic and real.” At dinner, the 90 Day Fiancé&nbsp;star’s friends asked him if Darcey knew that he would soon be in New York. “Not now, because I have zero contact with her,” Jesse explained.</p><p>The 26-year-old even claimed that Darcey had&nbsp;refused to stop contacting him&nbsp;after their breakup. “I moved on from Darcey. But after the breakup, she was stalking me ever since, in any possible way,” he alleged. “She has been contacting me over and over again.”</p><p>Darcey’s texts and calls only stopped, he said, after he&nbsp;threatened her with legal action. (It’s important to note that Darcey has&nbsp;denied Jesse’s claims, suggesting they are mostly for publicity on his part.)</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=darcey-silva-and-tom></span><span>Darcey Silva and Tom</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tom and Darcey didn’t end on the best of terms, there is one thing Tom would like to thank his ex for. He asked her to refrain from bringing up one area of his life, his daughter, on the show. And she did.</p><p>“I was with someone for eight years. I have a daughter with her. That’s one thing I’ll thank Darcey for. I said I don’t want her brought up in the show, which she didn’t. They live in Switzerland. I didn’t even want that involved in the show. So, yeah, I’ve had long relationships. I’m not just a revolving door as my sister likes to call me,” he said.</p><p>Though Tom was with the mother of his daughter for eight years, they were never married. But Tom says he would like to settle down with someone someday.</p><p>“I don’t know if I want a family in terms of more children. I think that’s a huge commitment. Unless it’s with the right person, then no. But, of course, I’d like to meet someone I’d like to spend the rest of my life with. I think we all do at some point,” he said. “We can’t just go out every Friday night and sit in champagne and cigar bars, can we?”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=darcey-silva-job></span><span>Darcey Silva Job</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It is now well known that Darcey Silva gained attention for appearing on <strong>90 Day Fiance</strong> with her much younger boyfriend <strong>Jesse Meester</strong>.
