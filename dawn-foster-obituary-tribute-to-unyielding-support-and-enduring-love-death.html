Her family and friends have our deepest condolences in this time of loss. Hopewell Township resident Dawn E. Foster (née Elbirn), who was 67 years old, passed away in a calm and serene manner at her residence on Tuesday morning, December 5, 2023. Her parents, Louis J. Sr. and Rosina E. Elbirn (née Vonau), both passed away before she was born in Bridgeton.</p><p>She was their daughter. She had been a resident of the area for her entire life and had graduated from Bridgeton High School in 1974. It was very evident that Dawn considered that both being a mother and a grandma were the most significant things she had achieved in her life. Whether it was her children’s friends, her workplace, or anyone else she came into contact with who she felt was in need, she showed this compassion and generosity to them all. In addition to having a passion for history and all things nostalgic, Dawn was a voracious reader. At the same time that Dawn was employed as a cashier at Bottino’s Shop Rite in Upper Deerfield Township for 21 years, she was also employed as a teacher’s assistant for the Bridgeton Board of Education for more than 23 years.</p><p>Previously, she was a member of the Trinity United Methodist Church, which is located in Bridgeton.<br>She is survived by her two children, Elizabeth Bevan (Jeffery) of Pitman and James Foster (Sara) of Chatom, Alabama; her four grandchildren, Samuel Bevan, Ayden Foster, Bryant Foster, and Haylee Foster; and her brother, John Elbirn, who resides in Bridgeton.</p><p>A funeral service will be held on Monday afternoon, December 11, 2023 at four o’clock at the Freitag Funeral Home, which is located at 137 W. Commerce Street in Bridgeton. The Reverend Jerry Fields, who is affiliated with the New Hope Baptist Church in Cedarville, will preside over the ceremony. Relatives and friends are cordially welcome to attend. Private services will be held at the Broad Street Cemetery in Bridgeton for the interment of the deceased. In the afternoon of Monday, between the hours of three and four, friends will be received at the funeral home. As an alternative to sending flowers, the family requests that donations be sent to the Children’s Literacy Initiative, which may be found at 990 Spring Garden Street, Suite 400, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19173.<strong><br></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwsMCwpWaen6jBpr6MqJmirKWWv7p506ugm62kmnq1u4yupbKhlaGxqrrGZqquqKCkv7V5wKebZp2emcKztc2gZKWnppp6pbHArZ9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
