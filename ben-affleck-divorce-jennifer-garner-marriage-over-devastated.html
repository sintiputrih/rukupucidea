In fact, Jen made desperate attempts to save their marriage just for the&nbsp;sake of their kids.&nbsp;However, sometimes people do just grow apart like Ben and &nbsp;Jen&nbsp;and it’s only best if they continue being a parent separately.&nbsp;We’re glad that they at least tried to patch things up before calling it quits.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Their kids are their biggest priority, and they want to make the divorce transition as easy on them as possible. Though they’ve been separated, Ben has been living at the house for that reason. “These are things that they have consciously done because they want to make sure that this is as easy as they can make it on the kids,” the source adds.</p><h3>Ben Affleck & Jennifer Garner Divorce Could Last Years</h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>Though the couple filed for divorce on June 30, it could actually take years for the split to be considered official since they have no prenup,<strong>Vikki Ziegler</strong>, top New York City attorney and star of Bravo’s&nbsp;Untying the Knot,&nbsp;told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife.com.</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“There’s a lot at stake, including the homes, the children and the bank accounts. There could be a long negotiation if there is an issue between them that we don’t know about, versus them just being friends and amicably resolving their case.” We continue to hope for the best for Ben, Jen and their family.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>To hear more about Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, head over to iTunes and download the HollywoodLife podcast for free!</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>What do YOU think,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?
