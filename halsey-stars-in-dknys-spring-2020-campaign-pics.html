For all of its success and excitement and the terrifying days in-between where I wondered if this path was truly mine to call my own.”</p><p>With the subway serving as the backdrop to this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spring campaign</a>, washes of blue, red and purple light give it an almost musical air as if Halsey were about to break out into song donning some of these laid-back looks.</p><p></p><p>This is the second campaign the “Without Me” singer has appeared in for the brand. She also starred in the fall 2019 #IAMDKNY campaign, where she also shared the significance of her connection to NYC.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>To see all the different looks she wears in DKNY’s Spring 2020 campaign, keep scrolling.</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Get Tressed With Us to get the details of every hair love affair in Hollywood, from the hits and misses on the red carpet to your favorite celebrities’ street style ‘dos (and don’ts!)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvHmqOsnaliwLWt0axkoqZdmbivxdJmqqmqmaO0bn6Pa2dmm5GivaK1xqdkqaGTqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
