Mya, who hasn’t publicly dated anyone for years, signed the post, “Officially, Mrs. Lansky,” but it’s unclear to whom she was referring.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mya-Weds-in-Secret-Ceremony-in-Seychelles.jpg><p>However, hours later Mya released the music video <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">for her single “The Truth,”</a> which featured her wearing the same wedding dress on the beach in the Seychelles islands that she shared on Instagram.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ first reported</a> that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Washington, D.C., </a>native had tied the knot in December 2019 in a beach ceremony in the Seychelles islands off the African coast.</p><p>The “Case of the Ex” singer posted a series of photos on Wednesday, February 12, from her concert in Dallas, where <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she wore a large ring on her index finger </a>instead of her ring finger.</p><p>Over the years, the Dancing With the Stars season 9 runner-up has been linked to <strong>DeSean Jackson</strong>, <strong>Larry Johnson</strong>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jay-Z</strong> </a>and <strong>The Game.</strong> However, she’s recently kept her love life quiet with no posts of a beau on social media.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The “My Love Is Like… Wo” singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told Hot 97 in 2018</a> that although she was single at the time that she planned to keep her romantic life private in the future.</p><p>“My intention has always been love and connection with a person beyond anything else,” Mya explained. “I’ve been so private because I didn’t want it to make or break me or to be a public stunt. I’ve really fired a lot of managers that had that mindset or publicists that had that mindset of, ‘Oh, you need to go on a date with this person because it’s going to help album sales.’ No thank-you. That’s not my flow. I don’t like it. I understand it from that perspective.”</p><p>However, Mya has been far from low-key about sharing her career achievements. The R&B singer released her last full-length album, T.K.O. (The Knock Out), in April 2018 and has continued to tour for her new music. She also starred in VH1’s show Girls Cruise with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lil’ Kim</strong></a> and TLC’s <strong>Chilli</strong> in 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamsZFiuqK%2B0aKcrGWZo3q0scKrnK1lo5rGpLTEpaOeq12YsrOxzKilsmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
