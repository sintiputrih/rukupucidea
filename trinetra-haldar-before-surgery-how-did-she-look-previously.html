Being a trailblazer, she underwent gender affirmation at the age of 21, making her one of India’s first transgender content makers. She is the first transgender physician in Karnataka and graduated from Kasturba Medical College in Manipal. Dr. Trinetra’s influence as a physician and content creator is profound, surpassing boundaries and promoting inclusivity, even outside of her acting career.</strong></p><h2>Trinetra Haldar Before Surgery: How Did She Look Previously?</h2><p>Haldar Gummaraju underwent a path of self-discovery and resilience before receiving gender-affirming surgery at the age of 21, which has positioned her as a well-known advocate for the transgender population in India.
