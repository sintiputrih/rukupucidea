Of course, by definition, that means that Sugar Bear was involved with Mama June at one time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Honey Boo Boo Still Have A Relationship With Her Dad, Sugar Bear Thompson?</a></span></p><p>As Here Comes Honey Boo Boo fans will no doubt already know, Sugar Bear and Mama June became a couple in 2004.

However, even though it is wonderful that many people have quit using tobacco products, some of them will still suffer consequences from their past dependence.</p><p>After Sugar Bear Thompson regularly used chewing tobacco for more than a decade, he eventually put the habit behind him. Still, in May 2022, it seemed like Sugar Bear's past tobacco usage had caught up with him.</p><p>Following the end of his marriage to Jennifer, Sugar Bear wanted to look more attractive. As a result, Sugar Bear sought to get his teeth fixed in May 2022 and that led to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his dentist finding something very troubling</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While examining Sugar Bear's mouth, his dentist discovered several white spots on the Here Comes Honey Boo Boo star's gums.

Tragically for anyone who contracts them, cancers of the throat and mouth are extremely difficult to battle.</p><p>Fortunately for Sugar Bear, it turns out that he isn't one of many <a href=#>celebrities who've beaten cancer</a>.
