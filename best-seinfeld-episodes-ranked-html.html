But with 169 episodes in the Seinfeld archive, it’s understandable if you’re intimidated by the idea of entering the vault without a guide.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-4-0-1@published data-word-count=74><span><span><i></i></span>In the interest of both helping novices prioritize and reminding veterans about forgotten jewels, we’ve ranked every episode in the series from worst to best. The ratings are based less on cultural significance — you’ll find many recognizable episodes fairly low on the list — and more on the density and quality of jokes, the inclusion of multiple strong narrative arcs, and, to a lesser extent, how well the comedy and stories have aged.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-4-0-3@published data-word-count=34>We arrived at a count of 169 by considering all two-part and hour-long episodes as single entries. We also omitted the<a href=#> retrospective</a>. With every episode now available on demand, why waste time watching highlights?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-4-0-2@published data-word-count=46>That said, even the worst (well, maybe the fourth-worst) episode of Seinfeld is better than most of what you’ll currently find on network TV — and now it’s just a Netflix account away. The bingeing is going to be real, and it’s going to be spectacular.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-5-0-0@published data-word-count=67><strong>169. “The Puerto Rican Day Parade” (Season 9).</strong> An episode so racially offensive that <a href=#>NBC had to apologize upon its airing</a>, the second-greatest crime that “The Puerto Rican Day Parade” commits is simply not being funny enough. It’s the loosest version of a bottle episode to come out of the writers’ room — and of all the bottle episodes in Seinfeld’s run, it’s the dullest, full stop.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-6-0-0@published data-word-count=64><strong>168. “The Outing” (Season 4).</strong> After four seasons spent using George’s homophobia as a character flaw, the show wholeheartedly embraces gay panic as a plot device to a nonsensical, largely unfunny degree. The phrase “Not that there’s anything wrong with that” ascends to pop-culture permanency after a practical joke played by <a href=#>Elaine</a> causes a college newspaper reporter to mistake George and Jerry as lovers.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-7-0-0@published data-word-count=89><strong>167. “</strong><a href=#><strong>The Finale</strong></a><strong>” (Season 9). </strong>Is the final episode of Seinfeld <a href=#>really that bad</a>? They get what they deserve! It’s a long time coming! Symbolically, it’s perfect! But upon rewatching, you realize that, yeah, it is that bad. Not even the minor revelation that George cheated during “<a href=#>The Contest</a>” can save what is an uninspired parade of guest stars and forgotten characters. The final scene’s callback to Seinfeld’s first episode is a cute touch, but it’s not enough to save “The Finale”’s reputation as one of Seinfeld’s lowest points.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-8-0-0@published data-word-count=73><strong>166. “The Jacket” (Season 2).</strong> An episode about sitting around waiting for someone in a hotel lobby, “The Jacket” offers all the thrills of … sitting around waiting for someone in a hotel lobby. Notable only for the following bit of trivia: Lawrence Tierney, who plays Elaine’s cranky father, Alton Benes, attempted to steal a butcher knife from the set and mock-threatened Seinfeld with the very real prop when caught in the act.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-9-0-0@published data-word-count=60><strong>165. “The Tape” (Season 3).</strong> <a href=#>Elaine</a>’s sexy-voice answering-machine prank in this episode is mildly humorous, but the collective horndog mentality displayed by Jerry, George, and Kramer runs contrary to the show’s established platonic-frenemy dynamic. This episode also features the first appearance of Ping, the recurring Chinese-food-delivery-guy character who suffers a bike accident after an encounter with Elaine in “The Virgin.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-10-0-0@published data-word-count=91><b>164. “The Deal” (Season 2). </b>Larry David specifically wrote this episode to satisfy NBC brass’s continued demands to get Jerry and Elaine back together, and it’s easy to see why the writers’ room was eager to split them up shortly thereafter. “The Deal” packs at least one comedic punch — Jerry’s birthday gift of $182 cash to Elaine — but this brief rom-com digression (which includes a seemingly out-of-character coffee-shop convo between Jerry and George about Elaine’s sexual prowess) disrupts the considerable creative gains made at this point in the series.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-11-0-0@published data-word-count=95><strong>163. “The Chinese Woman” (Season 6). </strong><span>Jerry dates a woman who has the surname “Chang” but isn’t actually Chinese, which turns into a (possibly accidental) examination of racial stereotypes. “Isn’t that a little racist?” Elaine says when Jerry says he “loves Chinese women.” Jerry disagrees, but jokes about Confucius and conflating </span><span>L</span><span>s for </span><span>R</span><span>s now come off as especially dated. The introduction of the story arc where George’s parents consider getting a divorce — complete with a cameo from a cape-wearing Larry David, as Frank Costanza’s lawyer — provides more laughs than the titular woman.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-12-0-0@published data-word-count=69><b><span>162. “The Mango” (Season 5).</span></b> Talk of cunnilingus and faking orgasms on a single episode of network TV that aired in 1993 is groundbreaking stuff — but Jerry’s incessant needling of Elaine after she admits she “faked it” during their relationship grows tiresome. Meanwhile, Kramer’s fruit-obsessed subplot feels like a stale reprise of previous episode “The Ex-Girlfriend,” with the aphrodisiac qualities of mangoes standing in for the Mackinaw peaches.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-13-0-0@published data-word-count=81><b><span>161. “The Muffin Tops” (Season 8).</span></b> All you need to know about this late-period episode is that most of the characters end up in the dump, and they deserve to be there. Elaine and Mr. Lippman selling muffin tops and donating the bottoms to food banks, Jerry shaving his chest, Kramer’s ultra-meta “J. Peterman Reality Tour”: a bunch of half-formed ideas crammed into an episode where the only notable element is George finally — finally — getting fired from the Yankees.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-14-0-0@published data-word-count=66><strong>160. “The Ex-Girlfriend” (Season 2).</strong> An episode that builds to one specific punch line: A woman Jerry’s seeing doesn’t want to sleep with him because she doesn’t think he’s a funny comedian — and not much else. It’s also notable as the first episode where George explicitly acknowledges his homophobia: “You’re a little homophobic, aren’t you?” Elaine asks, to which he replies, “Is it that obvious?”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-15-0-0@published data-word-count=44><strong>159. “The Gum” (Season 7).</strong> The dynamic between George and perpetual nemesis Lloyd Braun is always a treat, but other episodes explore it better than “The Gum,” which largely and improbably focuses on Elaine accidentally exposing herself multiple times due to a faulty button.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-16-0-0@published data-word-count=53><b>158. “Male Unbonding” (Season 1). </b>The only episode in the series without the in the title and, arguably of more importance, the introduction of Elaine — even though the episode doesn’t give her much to do. Kramer’s first get-rich-quick scheme — a make-your-own-pizza restaurant — is the highlight of this otherwise-inconsequential early episode.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-17-0-0@published data-word-count=61><strong>157. “The Strong Box” (Season 9).</strong> Seinfeld mined some dark material over its run, but the central plot of “The Strong Box” — Kramer and Jerry dig up a neighbor’s dead parrot to retrieve a key that had been fed to the bird — is impossibly, joylessly grim. Proof that, even in Seinfeld’s universe, there’s such a thing as too dark.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-18-0-0@published data-word-count=60><strong>156. “The Dog” (Season 3).</strong> Following several episodes where George and Elaine successfully scheme together, it made no sense to build a story around their inability to hang out when Jerry isn’t present. That flawed premise led to 22 minutes with little more than frictionless dialogue. There was some decent physical comedy between Jerry and the offscreen canine Farfel, though.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-19-0-0@published data-word-count=48><strong>155. “The Stock Tip” (Season 1).</strong> Jerry’s weekend away with new flame Vanessa ends up being a sedate affair for him, Vanessa, and the viewers at home. Meanwhile, George’s success in the stock market serves as a reminder that it’s more enjoyable to see him lose than win.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-20-0-0@published data-word-count=63><strong>154. “The Seinfeld Chronicles” (Pilot).</strong> It was tempting to call Seinfeld’s first episode its worst: The pacing is molasses-slow, the dialogue is stiff, and the singular focus on Jerry’s romantic life doesn’t prove very interesting. But the first-ever scene between Jerry and Kramer in the former’s apartment is compelling enough to see why NBC brass decided to take a chance on the show.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-21-0-0@published data-word-count=39><b>153. “The Robbery” (Season 1). </b>Kramer’s negligence — which leads to Jerry’s apartment getting robbed — has implications for later seasons, but the gang’s real-estate squabbling drags down the episode’s momentum and doesn’t make for much of a plot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/196/a1e/3e33fa1213c4ee9d6deae78165312ba571-23-seinfeld-episode-rank.rsquare.w400.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-23-0-0@published data-word-count=57><strong>152. “The Parking Space” (Season 3).</strong> A fairly inconsequential episode about parallel parking and a weird noise in Jerry’s car, “The Parking Space” <a href=#>is memorable for its staging</a>: two cars, owned by George and Jerry’s friend Mike, respectively, in a diagonal standoff over a spot. If only the rest of the episode delivered on this visual punch.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-24-0-0@published data-word-count=39><b>151. “The Nose Job” (Season 3). </b>George’s horrified reaction to his girlfriend Audrey’s plastic surgery — which he talked her into — speaks to his despicable core, but there’s something ultimately dissatisfying about seeing Kramer end up with her.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-25-0-0@published data-word-count=63><strong>150. “The Suicide” (Season 3).</strong><span> How much </span><span>is</span><span> a Drake’s Coffee Cake, anyway? The many battles involving the pastry — who has it, who wants it, and, in a fasting Elaine’s case, whom she has to attack to get a bite of it herself — overshadow the episode’s lackluster main plot, which involves Jerry, a neighbor’s suicide attempt, and the neighbor’s amorous girlfriend.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-26-0-0@published data-word-count=44><strong>149. “The Postponement” (Season 7).</strong> This is mostly a comedown episode following George’s rushed engagement to Susan. Elaine’s entanglement with a blabby rabbi provides some laughs but is beset by a plot that’s a little too convoluted even for Seinfeld’s notoriously all-over-the-place later seasons.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-27-0-0@published data-word-count=47><strong>148. “The Checks” (Season 8).</strong> Elaine singing “Witchy Woman” to her unamused boyfriend Brett is an inspired moment. Less so is Kramer’s treatment of the Japanese tourists staying with him, even if the plot is more a commentary on Kramer’s ignorance than it is on Japanese culture.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-28-0-0@published data-word-count=66><strong>147. “The Shoes” (Season 4).</strong> What begins with George bungling a pilot deal with NBC after staring at the cleavage of the network honcho’s daughter ends with Elaine using her cleavage to manipulate that same boss into resurrecting the deal. So, yeah, an episode of Girls this is not — but Bob Balaban sneering in George’s ear, “Get a good look, Costanza?” is a delicious moment.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-29-0-0@published data-word-count=65><strong>146. “The Susie” (Season 8).</strong> Who is Susie? “I’m Susie, she’s me,” Elaine tells J. Peterman at the end of this episode — but Peterman doesn’t get it, and neither does the audience. The plot of “The Susie,” a mistaken-identity tale taken four or five steps too far, seems impressive at first, but in the end there are no failures or successes — just confusion.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-30-0-0@published data-word-count=61><strong>145. “The Keys” (Season 3). </strong>One of a few episodes in Seinfeld’s early seasons that temporarily upsets the show’s dynamic, the season-three finale sees Kramer flee to L.A. after Jerry demands his spare keys back. The story works best as an extended setup for the supersize L.A.-centric episode “The Trip,” though Kramer’s Murphy Brown cameo at the end provides perfect punctuation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/8c9/9ef/b49f28c9171de3f1e8371d508061377f0e-23-seinfeld-parking-spot.rhorizontal.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-32-0-0@published data-word-count=62><strong>144. “The Apartment” (Season 2).</strong> “GET OUT!” Elaine’s first shove is captured in this early episode, but “The Apartment” is most notable for George engaging in hilariously despicable behavior for the first time, when he pretends to be married to pick up women at a party. The rest of the episode focuses on Jerry not wanting Elaine to move into his building.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-34-0-0@published data-word-count=60><strong>143. “The Soup Nazi” (Season 7).</strong> One of many episodes where the cultural resonance (“No soup for you!”) overshadows the episode’s just-okay comedic material — George’s annoyance at Jerry and his girlfriend Sheila calling each other “schmoopie” is funny, but Elaine and Kramer’s subplot just sits there like the armoire they try (and fail) to move into the former’s apartment.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-35-0-0@published data-word-count=65><strong>142. “The Smelly Car” (Season 4).</strong> On one hand: George fretting that he “turned” Susan gay is hilarious in that it further mines his own neurotic bigotry. On the other hand: Suggesting that Kramer can “turn” Susan’s girlfriend straight toes the line of ignorance, especially in hindsight. But Jerry’s car really stinks, and seeing everyone make a gas face when they enter it is funny.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-36-0-0@published data-word-count=84><b>141. “The Visa” (Season 4). </b>Ping returns, as does Babu Bhatt (who lost his restaurant after Jerry’s meddling in “The Café”). The former is suing Elaine for the accident detailed in “The Virgin,” and the latter gets deported after a mail mix-up between Jerry, Elaine, and George. What saves “The Visa” from a place in the bottom ten of this list is George forcing Jerry not to be funny so he can impress a girlfriend, only for the girlfriend to fall for fake-sad Jerry.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-37-0-0@published data-word-count=45><strong>140. “The Package” (Season 8).</strong> There’s some painfully funny pathos found in Elaine’s (and, eventually, Uncle Leo’s) attempts to get proper medical coverage while being labeled as a “difficult” patient. George’s pre-sexting-era attempt to exchange racy photos with a one-hour-photo employee, however, falls comparatively flat.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-38-0-0@published data-word-count=58><strong>139. “The Watch” (Season 4).</strong> George botching his and Jerry’s NBC deal is nails-on-a-chalkboard uncomfortable — and quite funny as a result — but this episode exists as little more than a way to push forward the Jerry and George pilot arc that runs through the fourth season (and to further establish Uncle Leo’s, uh, unique character traits).</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-39-0-0@published data-word-count=42><strong>138. “The Wig Master” (Season 7).</strong> The Kramer-as-pimp payoff isn’t worth what precedes it, but it’s funny to see George double-teamed in a domestic situation by both Susan and the wig master staying with them. Is Craig’s ponytail approaching a man-bun? Discuss!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-41-0-0@published data-word-count=43><strong>137. “The Stakeout” (Season 1).</strong> What distinguishes this early episode is the creation of George’s architect-cum-importer/exporter alter ego, Art Vandelay (initially “Art Vandercore” and “Art Corvolet”).

It’s true that this episode is as groundbreaking as Seinfeld gets — it drives home the “show about nothing” conceit and makes it work structurally, laying the groundwork for many future TV shows (as well as many future episodes of Seinfeld). But if we can be real here: The plot of “The Chinese Restaurant” takes way too long to get going, a common problem with many early-era Seinfeld episodes. Once it does, though, it’s best moments — Elaine attempting to eat off a patron’s plate as part of a bet, the restaurant’s host yelling “Cartwright!” when George’s girlfriend calls looking for him — make it an above-average episode with a narrative device that delivers the rest of the way.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-100-0-0@published data-word-count=63><strong>84. “The Note” (Season 3). </strong><span>Possibly the most flagrant display of homophobia from George, who Can’t.

You can eat them like an apple!</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-184-0-0@published data-word-count=77><b><span>4. “The Fire” (Season 5). </span></b>Annnnnnd, <a href=#>this</a> might be the worst thing George does in the entire nine seasons of the show. The police officer asking him how, exactly, he lives with himself is a proxy for all of us. Props to the writers for plotting a complicated but totally sound “No bad deed goes unpunished” story involving Jerry and Elaine, where the former’s fulfillment of every comedian’s revenge fantasy results in the latter losing a promotion.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-185-0-0@published data-word-count=109><strong>3. “The Opposite” (Season 5). </strong>What if doing the exact opposite of what you would typically do in a given situation could improve your life? The season-five finale mines this question in what is possibly Seinfeld’s most effective attempt at magical realism. “The Opposite” takes a hard look at the show’s power dynamic and treats George and Elaine like elevators: One goes up and the other goes down, while Jerry remains neutral (or, as Kramer refers to him, “Even Steven”). Elaine’s realization at the end of the episode that she’s <a href=#>“become George”</a> is one of the show’s funniest moments. (Also, the Kramer-meets–Regis and Kathie Lee scene is truly inspired.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-186-0-0@published data-word-count=75><strong>2. “The Subway” (Season 3). </strong><span>What keeps this from being No. 1? We’re down to the end, so it’s a matter of pedanticism: When the cop busts the mugger who’s trying to steal Kramer’s OTB winnings, there’s an applause track that doesn’t match the show’s established antipathy toward sentimentality. That’s enough to drop it a spot. Everything else about “The Subway” is as pitch-perfect and refreshing as an empty, air-conditioned 4 train in the summertime.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-188-0-0@published data-word-count=72><strong>1. “</strong><a href=#><strong>The Contest</strong></a><strong>” (Season 4). </strong>Even today it’s easy to marvel at how much comedy is packed into these 22 minutes without feeling like overkill: George’s odd choices for masturbation material [“Glamour?!”], Estelle Costanza yelling at him in the hospital room, the sponge bath, “I’m out!” Elaine’s JFK Jr. obsession, and the episode ending with the gang ostensibly watching Kramer have sex with the naked woman in the apartment across the street.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f77146c70cb0e6f44eb1ccf186eb0f3e-189-0-0@published data-word-count=71>At this point in the show’s run, Seinfeld had already incorporated several clever masturbation jokes into episodes. But here, the show’s architects created an entire episode about it without once saying the word, instead creating their own language that doesn’t resort to cheap euphemisms. (The closest they come is Estelle’s “I find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park” remark, which still kills.) Peerless TV, no question.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ambrose-d37b2a16084c1e8447a4e277efb51154@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>How Jerry Seinfeld Changed Modern Comedy With <i>Seinfeld</i></span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ambrose-26c49fc1e01a6827e666963cd87aed51@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>How Classic <i>Seinfeld</i> Episodes Were Written</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>All 169 Seinfeld Episodes, Ranked From Worst to Best</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wZ6qrWWjmravssSlm2adoJ7AsLDErGSrmZ6gsqV6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
