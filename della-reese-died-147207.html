I know heaven has a brand new angel this day. Della Reese will be forever in our hearts. Rest In Peace, sweet angel. We love you,” Roma concluded her message, published on Monday, Nov. 20. Della is survived by three children, James Reese, Franklin Reese, and Dominique Reese, and her husband, Franklin.

Throughout the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s, Della starred in several popular movies including Harlem Nights, A Thin Line Between Love and Hate, and Expecting Mary. In 1994, she landed her most-beloved role as Tess on the TV drama Touched by an Angel, which ran until 2003. Our thoughts are with Della’s family and friends during this sad time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46dnKWkkWK%2FprHSnmSdoZWZenKAlmtncGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
