Although the mangaka of the series, Yusuke Murata, publishes his chapters on a bi-weekly basis, the publication timetable for the forthcoming chapters has not yet been determined. Saitama and Tatsumaki’s bout in the previous chapter ended two fights in N-City and H-City. They ultimately succeeded in taking down the Iron Fist gang in N-City.

The mangaka does release the chapters on Thursdays at 12 am JST, albeit the publishing date for the next chapter has not yet been determined. International readers can also access the manga concurrently. On the official website of Viz Media, the chapter’s official English translations might not be available for another week. On March 16, 2023, One Punch Man Chapter 181 is anticipated to be released on Viz Media’s official website and Shueisha’s Tonari no Young Jump website.</p><h2 id=h-what-we-can-expect-from-chapter-181>What we can expect from Chapter 181</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The fight between Saitama and Tatsumaki, which was left off in the previous episode, is where One Punch Man Chapter 181 should ideally pick off. Yet, given that more details regarding the Tsukuyomi group’s relationship with God could soon be disclosed, there is a strong possibility that the next chapter could center on them. Saitama and Tatsumaki’s altercation will be broken up, as in the original comics, by Speed-o’-Sound Sonic. While Saitama and Tatsumaki were engaged in combat, the villain recognized Saitama and started to pursue him. Although there isn’t a lot of information in the comics, Yusuke Murata might opt to add some to One Punch Man chapter 181.</p><p>Tatsumaki, who ought to be in a great deal of suffering by that point due to her reopened injuries, might try to meet Fubuki once she disbands the Blizzard group. It is tough to guess what adjustments Yusuke Murata will be made to the manga given how their prior meeting turned out. But, given their plot, it seems unlikely that there will be any significant alterations. The Blizzard gang refused to leave Fubuki even after he abolished the organization. As a result, there is a good probability that they will visit her again and try to find a solution that would bring them back together. As a result, there is a significant probability that One Punch Man Chapter 181 will contain a discussion about how the Blizzard gang would approach Fubuki.</p><h2 id=h-what-happened-in-chapter-180>What Happened in Chapter 180</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.sportslumo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/06215713/Tatsumuki-compressed-1024x576.jpg><p>Tatsumaki and Saitama’s fight was depicted in One Punch Man chapter 180, “Busy,” as it traveled across numerous places. In the end, they managed to stop the Iron Fist gang from killing A-Class hero Feather. They had previously had his partner Erika pretend that she didn’t care for him. Nevertheless, they were vanquished by Saitama and Tatsumaki, who unintentionally came upon them. Soon later, their battle moved to H-City, where Kenzan Rat, a Dragon-level monster, was doing havoc. Metal Bat did get there, but he didn’t have to do anything because Tatsumaki and Saitama accidentally flew right through the creature’s head.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnn6OybrzUp5qhZZ2Wu265wKeemmWTna6xwMSrZGpwYWLEqa3TZquoZZWtvaav02apnqSVlsCmecOaq55lkaOxbsPHnqmeZaSkerOxwJ1kraCVYrCprc%2BtnKtln6O5qrrEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
