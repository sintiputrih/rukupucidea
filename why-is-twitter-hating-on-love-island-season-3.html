However, unlike with its previous seasons, Twitter is not a fan of everything going on, and its users are not afraid to show it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout Twitter, users have talked about three specific cast members: Josh, Shannon, and Cashay. All three of them were fan favorites for viewers every week. Cast members Josh Goldstein and Shannon St. Clair left together on day 31, while Cashay Proudfoot left on day 32.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Love Island USA': Meet The Hot New Singles Ready To Find Love In Season 3</a></span></p><p>Now that they're gone, users believe the show will no longer be worth watching&nbsp;compared to when Goldstein, St. Claire, and Proudfoot were still there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although fans were saddened to see them depart, it came as no surprise, as Goldstein had just received news that his sister had passed away. However, since they were the front-running couple of the show,&nbsp;Love Island fans are hoping to see them return by the end of the season.</p><p>Before the couple left, Goldstein made sure to speak with all of the members. After the episode aired, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!&nbsp;Online reported</a> that Goldstein told his castmates, "I just need to be home with my family right now to support them. I just want to let you guys know that I'm so grateful to have met all of you, consider you all my best friends. We're going to see each other again. This isn't it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Originating in the U.K., Love Island&nbsp;is a show that involves a group of contestants (known as islanders) living in isolation under video surveillance. The islanders must couple up and compete to win $100,000. Although Goldstein and St. Claire became a couple, partners can also be together out of friendship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Love Island': Fans Want Christian To Leave The Villa ASAP</a></span></p><p>Goldstein and St. Clair were the longest-lasting couples living in the house before they decided to leave together.&nbsp;As of this publication, there has been no confirmation on whether or not the couple is still together. However, St. Clair's latest Instagram photo was of her and Goldstein, and she's also shared posts regarding his sister's death on her Instagram story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, another big shock was the departure of Proudfoot, who left after cast member, Charlie Lynch, chose to pursue a relationship with housemate Alana Paolucci. Due to this elimination, some have thought that Lynch would become Love Island's public enemy number one. However, Proudfoot said she knew it would not work out, and she left with no regrets.</p><p>The departure of a fan-favorite usually affects shows greatly. Examples of this have been seen before on various shows in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bachelor franchise</a>, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bachelor in Paradise</a>.</p><p>Goldstein and St. Claire were the first couple to leave the show together before the show ended, rather than separately. Proudfoot, however, was sent home due to the show's rules.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is How Fake 'Love Island' Really Is</a></span></p><p>Love Island is available to watch on Hulu and Paramount+.
