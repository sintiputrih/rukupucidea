Thanks to the L&O fam for being so welcoming! #LawAndOrder @nbc @wolfentertainment.”</p><p>Goldwyn shared two photos from set, including a group shot with <strong>Reid Scott</strong> and <strong>Mehcad Brooks</strong>, who play detectives Vincent Riley and Jalen Shaw, respectively, on the procedural.</p><p>Goldwyn, who joins the series as district attorney Nicholas Baxter on Thursday, March 16, also posted a snap of himself sitting in a Law & Order director’s chair. His back is turned the camera as he seemingly soaks in his upcoming role.</p><p>Goldwyn’s addition to the Law & Order family comes in the wake of Waterston’s exit on this week’s season 23 episode. Waterston initially joined <a href=#>the <strong>Dick Wolf</strong> series</a> as Executive ADA Jack McCoy during season 5 in 1994. (The show premiered in 1990.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Tony-Goldwyn-Says-He-Has-Some-Very-Large-Shoes-to-Fill-Replacing-Sam-Waterston-on-Law-and-Order-2.jpg><p>When the series went off the air in 2010 after 20 seasons, Waterston’s character had been upgraded to DA. Law & Order was <a href=#>revived in 2022</a> and Waterston, 83, returned to help launch it back to life.</p><p>NBC announced earlier this month month that Waterston is <a href=#>stepping down as his beloved character</a> on Thursday, February 22. Goldwyn was named as his replacement. “It’s a pleasure to talk directly like this to the backbone of Law & Order’s absolutely amazing audience. The time has come for me to move on and take Jack McCoy with me,” Waterston said in a statement via Wolf Entertainment in January. “There’s sadness in leaving, but I’m just too curious about what’s next.”</p><p>He added: “An actor doesn’t want to let himself get too comfortable. I’m more grateful to you than I can say. L&O’s continuing and amazing long run, along with its astounding come-back, is all thanks to you and to Dick Wolf, but for whose vision, patience, perseverance, and unique combination of creative and business talents, none of this would have happened. I feel very blessed. I hope to see you all on the flip side.”</p><p>Brooks, who has worked with Waterston since season 21, <a href=# rel=noopener>gushed over the actor on Wednesday</a>, as the team prepared to say goodbye on screen the following day.</p><p>“To Sam Waterston, I would say, I hope I am half the man he is when I grow up. He’s an absolute legend,” Brooks, 43, said in an Instagram video shared via NBC Law & Order’s official account. “We’re going to really miss him. His energy is infectious, in the best way possible.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Fans of the flagship legal drama have already seen one casting shakeup this season after<strong> Jeffrey Donovan</strong> confirmed in November 2023 that <a href=#>he would not be back</a> for season 23.
