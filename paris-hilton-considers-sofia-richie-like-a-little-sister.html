She gets it. She’s like this fashionista. It’s so fun.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Paris-Hilton-Nicole-Richie-2018.jpg><p>Sofia also thinks of the Paris Hilton Lingerie designer like a family member. Sofia revealed in a 2016 interview with <a href=#>Wonderland</a> magazine that Hilton was “one of my closest friends in the industry.”</p><p>“It’s really nice to have her kind of, as like a sister, because she’s been through it all and she gives the best advice and she wants the best for me and she sees how my path is going,” she added. “She’s really rooting for me and giving me the best tips, how to avoid certain things and how to be the best version of myself that I can be.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>And while Hilton’s relationship with her former <a href=#>The Simple Life</a> costar has been anything but simple over the years, she still <a href=#>considers her a good friend</a>, as well. “Nicole is the most hilarious person in the world,” she says. “I love her House of Harlow Line. It’s so chic and she has <a href=#>great style</a> and she’s always been that way.”</p><p>With reporting by Carly Sloane</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapmaKewG60yKWrqKZdmLyvv8idnKurXai8p7XAZqmim5iesm64yKScZpldoba1wMueZKyho6mys3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
