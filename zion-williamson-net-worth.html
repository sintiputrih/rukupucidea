Zion Williamson was born in a family that was no stranger to sports. Both of his parents were once athletes. His father, Lateef Williamson was a defensive end in high school and college football. His mother, Sharonda Sampson, was involved in athletics as a sprinter. She competed as a sprinter at the same college as his father, before she went on to become a Physical Education teacher. When Zion was five, his biological parents divorced, and he went on to live with his mother who remarried. His stepfather, Lee Anderson, had played basketball in college. Zion loved basketball that it became part of him.&nbsp;</p><p>At the age of 9, Zion without the assistance of his parents will rise up as early as 05.00 AM to train. He did it often. Having a stepfather who played basketball in college and a mother who was once a sprinter came in handy for Williamson as both did their best to horn their son’s skills. He competed at the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) circuit, against opponents older than him by 4 years. He did this with the coaching guidance of his mother. His stepfather helped him greatly in building the skills he needed to become a very adept point guard. Williamson attended Johnakin Middle School, where he was coached by his mother. Williamson’s basketball antics was impressive as he lost only three games in 2 years.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=career-summary></span><strong>Career Summary</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zion Williamson attended Spartanburg Day School, where he was greatly involved in the varsity basketball program. The growth spurt he experienced between 8th and 9th grade where he grew as tall as 6 feet 3 inches, was greatly beneficial for him. Before he began high school at Spartanburg Day School, he practised hard at the school’s gym and perfected his dunking skills. His first year of high school basketball was impressive as he received All-Region and All-State honours.</p><p>In his second year in high school, he added three more inches to his height and led his school to claim the South Carolina Independent School Association (SCISA) Region I-2A championship. He was then awarded the SCISA Region I-2A Player of the Year award. By his junior year, he was a national sensation as his highlight videos went viral.&nbsp;</p><p>His performance that season earned him another SCISA Player of the Year award. He also competed in Adidas Nations camp, where he finished as MVP. His senior year at high school saw him lead his school to a third successive SCISA Region I-2A championship. At the end of his senior year, he was named South Carolina Mr Basketball and emerged runner-up in Mr Basketball USA. Right from his first year in high school, colleges have tried to get Williamson to commit to their programs. From 2015 to 2018 he received offers from Wofford College, Clemson University, University of North Carolina, University of Florida, University of South Carolina, and Duke University.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, he finally committed to Duke University. At Duke University, Williamson spent one season playing college basketball. His performance during the season earned him several awards such as the ACC Player of the Year, Rookie of the Year, and ACC Athlete of the Year awards. In an injury he sustained during the season, his foot shot out of his Nike shoe and he slipped causing him to sustain an injury. The injury impacted heavily on Nike, as they lost much money in stocks. Though Williamson was one of three top recruits in the Duke University squad, they couldn’t win the NCAA tournament as they lost to the Michigan State in the Final of the East Regional.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Photo: USATSI</figure><p>In June 2019, Williamson entered the 2019 NBA Draft and was selected as the top pick by the New Orleans Pelicans.
