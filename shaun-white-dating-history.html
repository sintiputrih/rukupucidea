Neither of them confirmed the rumors, and next time a rumor started about Shaun White's dating life, it wasn't confirmed either.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Rumors then swirled around Shaun dating Summer Spiro, an actress who is best known for her role in Westworld.</p><p>The two were rumored to be together for four years, although there aren't any instances of either of them confirming their relationship in interviews or on social media.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Shaun was then allegedly dating Love Island host <a href=#>Arielle Vandenberg</a>. The two were linked and rumored to be an item in 2011, but again, other than a few photographs of them together, nothing was confirmed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In 2012, Shaun was spotted kissing model <a href=#>Bar Refaeli</a> at a bar in New York. A source told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a> at the time, "They were all over each other. They were dancing, hugging, kissing — you name it."</p><p>Even if the source was correct, clearly being seen at a bar together doesn't mean they're dating, and these rumors of love fizzled pretty quickly.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In 2013, Shaun went public with his relationship with singer Sarah Barthel.</h2><p>In 2013, Shaun started a relationship with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah Barthel,</a> lead singer of the group Phantogram. During an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald in 2019, Shaun spoke about his relationship with Sarah, one of the only times he's publicly spoken about her or anyone else he's been linked to.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"Sarah is a genuine and beautiful person. I travel so much and so does she, but we make an effort to keep it together," he said to the newspaper. "I’m not in the kids-and-marriage head space now, but one day for sure. I have learnt how to be a good friend by being with her. All my life it’s been about me and my work and my goals. It’s nice to hear about someone else and what they’re doing."</p><p>Sadly, the couple split shortly after.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Today, Shaun is dating 'Vampire Diaries' star Nina Dobrev.</h2><p>The couple sparked dating rumors in February 2020 when they were spotted on a trip to South Africa. Shortly after, Shaun and Nina Dobrev made their relationship<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Instagram official in May 2020,</a> sharing a behind-the-scenes look at their time quarantining together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In October 2021, Shaun opened up about his long-distance relationship with Nina, telling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, "We have a nice little system of how to stay in touch. Plane tickets are pretty much booked for any opportunity that we can go see one another. So, I know during the holiday break, we’re going to meet up, and we’re going to meet up again probably around Christmas time. Anything that happens in between, then I’ll jet over and see her. You just make it work."</p><p>Now, we'll just have to wait and see if Nina will be cheering Shaun on at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLWiwc1mrqGhpJp6pa3ToqWgZZiewLW70bI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
