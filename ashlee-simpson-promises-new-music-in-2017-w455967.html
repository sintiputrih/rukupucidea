It’s been eight long years since </span><b><a href=#>Ashlee Simpson</a> </b><span>released her last album, </span><i>Bittersweet World</i><span>, but she assures </span><i>Us Weekly</i><span> that fans won’t have to wait </span><i>too</i><span> much longer for a follow-up. While sipping coffee-infused cocktails at the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf Holiday Celebration in Los Angeles on December 13, Simpson told Us that she and her husband of two years, </span><b>Evan Ross</b><span>, have been hard at work on a very special project. Explained Simpson, “We’re working on an album together. So in the new year, that will be happening! It’s been really fun to work together.”</span></p><p>The parents of <a href=#>16-month-old daughter Jagger Snow </a>say that working together has been a pleasure. “When you work separately,” Ross explained, “you don’t get to hang out — so this works out well.” Added Simpson, “This way we can tour together! I’m definitely excited. I love working with my husband.”</p><p>The two describe their new sound as “soulful, fun and reflective of music that [we] both like” — but they were quick to add that Simpson hopes to also do a solo album in the not-too-distant future. “We’re doing this album together and then we’ll go off and do our own,” says the “Pieces of Me” singer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>The mom of two (Simpson shares son Bronx, 8, with ex-husband <b>Pete Wentz</b>) says that prioritizing her parenting duties accounts for her long absence from the charts. “I think being a mom kind of took the place of [music], definitely. She told Us. Added her husband, “I don’t think she ever really stopped. Music is something so important to both of us. So we’ll release this album and then she’ll work on hers.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Another thing that’s important to the couple? Expanding their family! Discussing their upcoming album, Simpson laughed, saying, “We’re doing this – before the next baby!” Explained Ross, whose mom is legendary singer Diana Ross, “I want a ton [of kids]! I think I want more than she does! I grew up with five kids in my family, and that was great.”</p><p>For now, the couple is enjoying the kids that they already have. Said Simpson of her daughter, “She’s daddy’s little twin! But if you’re around her, she definitely has my mannerisms and she’s goofy like me. Anything her brother is doing, she wants to do.” And Bronx is OK with that? “He is the best big brother. He is so sweet,” Simpson gushed. “He is so protective of her and I think that will continue. And we all laugh at her because she’s so funny! He’s honestly so good with her, it’s awesome. We do everything together as a family. The age difference doesn’t matter – she’s excited about anything he’s doing. And the three of us play games and she’s so happy to just hang out and chill with everyone.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaaq5ihsqZ50qKkqaufo3qxvs6moKydo2K7psOMpqysoZNitq95kWlocGWnaYJ2hZVwZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
