Some may know strapping actor Craig Bierko from the 2000 Broadway production of The Music Man, flicks like Scary Movie 4 and Cinderella Man, or the newish Fox sitcom Unhitched, on which he was apparently sodomized by an ape. Now he has a new gig on the funny-vid Website Superdeluxe: In “Bathing with Bierko,” he sits in a tub sudsing up John Malkovich while the two talk thoughtfully about the strangeness of the word “Portugal” when said over and over, before enacting a McDonald’s drive-up–window scenario, with Malk as the docile cashier."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Bierko, who says stars are clamoring to be in the next installments but wouldn’t name names, talked to Vulture about the process in detail…but remained elusive on one key point.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6f3a36926f065022ea966e2b84794048-2-0-0@published data-word-count=19><strong>So it looks like you guys were both naked in the tub. Were you?</strong><br>I have no comment on that.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6f3a36926f065022ea966e2b84794048-3-0-0@published data-word-count=23><strong>You can’t say? What’s the big deal?</strong><br>I can, but I won’t. I guess I want to preserve a bit of mystery. We’re bathing.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6f3a36926f065022ea966e2b84794048-4-0-0@published data-word-count=30><strong>Are your legs wrapped around him or are you cross-legged behind him?</strong><br>I think they were around his legs. The tub is too small for me, and he’s about my height.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6f3a36926f065022ea966e2b84794048-5-0-0@published data-word-count=96><strong>So this woman on Nerve.com, Sara Benincasa, who has long <a href=#>interviewed people in their tubs</a> on a thing called “Tub Talk,” is claiming you stole her idea. True?</strong><br>I don’t really have a response to that. My idea behind this whole thing was, I wanted to take the false intimacy of a talk show, of two guys wearing makeup, and turn the intimacy up as much as I could. I thought of people sitting in the bathtub yammering at each other, and I could see how other people could have come up…I’d never seen her show before.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6f3a36926f065022ea966e2b84794048-6-0-0@published data-word-count=31><strong>She suggests you could set things aright by having her on your tub show. Will you?</strong><br>Probably not. Not to insult her, but we’ve set the bar pretty high with John [Malkovich].</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6f3a36926f065022ea966e2b84794048-7-0-0@published data-word-count=32><strong>Who else is on your wish list?</strong><br>Gore Vidal, Jimmy Carter. To get Jimmy and Rosalynn together would be fantastic. Hillary. The people that you would tune in to watch on <i>Larry King</i>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6f3a36926f065022ea966e2b84794048-8-0-0@published data-word-count=87><strong>Okay. Back to John. What did you do before the shoot? Drink?</strong><br>I said that we’d start at 3 p.m., and he showed up at 2:45. I don’t think in the history of show business that’s ever happened. All he asked for was a cup of black coffee. Carrie [Fisher, his friend, whose house they shot it at] was out of town. We made a pot, and that was it. We were stoned out of our minds on the bean. We have about an hour’s worth of tape.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6f3a36926f065022ea966e2b84794048-9-0-0@published data-word-count=42><strong>Was there water in the tub? You can’t see it.</strong><br>Yes. Next time we’ll make sure you can see a little bit more water and hear the ambient splashing. We kept replenishing it to make sure it was warm. That was John’s job.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6f3a36926f065022ea966e2b84794048-10-0-0@published data-word-count=42><strong>You wash his head for a long time. What did it feel like?</strong><br>Suspiciously human, which was a shock. He’s not naturally completely bald, so there was a hint of stubble. It felt like a hard skull encased in an envelope of flesh.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6f3a36926f065022ea966e2b84794048-11-0-0@published data-word-count=95><strong>It almost seems that by the time you get to the McDonald’s part he is virtually hypnotized from the massage.</strong><br>To be perfectly honest, and I know that given the project we’re discussing it seems ludicrous, but this is one of the best actors in the world, I believe. He asked me in all humbleness, “What are you looking for?,” and I said you should be as relaxed as you were doing <i>Charlie Rose</i>, which I’d seen him do. I could’ve been prodding him with a white-hot poker and he would’ve maintained that kind of composure.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6f3a36926f065022ea966e2b84794048-12-0-0@published data-word-count=68><strong>Did you hang out after?</strong><br>No, he put on his clothes, as I did. We gave him a gift of appreciation — a bunch of soap. On the way there, I’d realized I had to get loofahs and brushes, so I bought some extras for a gift pack for him. You know those giant soaps the size of a human forearm? We gave him a bunch of those things.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6f3a36926f065022ea966e2b84794048-13-0-0@published data-word-count=12><strong>Did you pay him?</strong><br>No, we just gave him the soap. —Tim Murphy</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Craig Bierko on Taking a Bath With John Malkovich</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlncWdgaXykvsCinpiamZq%2FrLuNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
