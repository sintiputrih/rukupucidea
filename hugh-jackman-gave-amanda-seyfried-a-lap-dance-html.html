(Now Macintosh just “thanks God” this cast was born.) “I was just thinking that my 27th year is probably going to be best,” Seyfried said after her awkward father-daughter birthday serenade, “because it was brought in in such a way that my hero, Mr. Hugh, got to stretch his cords one more time for me.” It would be an especially good year, we’d imagine, if Academy voters are equally swayed.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Hugh Jackman Gave Amanda Seyfried a Lap Dance</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWloa2dhZ3ypwcahZKOZk6C6orqMoJivnV2WuqK6w5pkrJ2pm7%2BqscNmmGakkaV6pa3NnJxnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
