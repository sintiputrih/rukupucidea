Although Micah and Irina were clocked by Netflix subscribers as "mean girls" from the get-go, it took longer for the true colors of other cast members to shine.

He said no at the altar.</h2><p>On social media, Paul denied the rumors that he may have cheated on Micah â€” and he doubled down on his denial during the Love Is Blind Season 4 reunion.

Fans were especially indignant on Paul's behalf when Micah introduced her fiancÃ© to two of <a href=#>her friends, Shelby</a> and Ruby, and they rudely made fun of him for giving a well-thought-out answer to whether Micah's looks matched up with how he pictured her in the pods.</p><p>Not to mention, Paul and Micah's personalities did seem to mesh very well. To many, Paul seemed very calculated, logical, and truly in search of a life partner â€” while many expressed that Micah appeared to be there for the attention/notoriety of being on a reality TV show.</p><p>On their wedding day, Micah gave Paul the opportunity to answer first at the altar. Paul said no and although Micah said she wasn't surprised, she was clearly heartbroken.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Love Is Blind' fans think Paul cheated on Micah with her bridesmaid, Ruby Mensing.</h2><p>After the wedding episode dropped on April 14, Love Is Blind fans took to social media to react to a blind-and-miss-it moment on Micah and Paul's wedding day. The scene showed Micah walking out of a room following his attempt to console Micah after she left him at the altar.
