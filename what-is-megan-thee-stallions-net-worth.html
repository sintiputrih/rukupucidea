Overall, she has 18 singles, collab or solo, in the last four years that have peaked in the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true>In 2021, she began reaping the rewards of her previous year. First, in March, she won three Grammys including Best New Artist. Then, in June, she won four BET Awards, more than anyone else in 2021.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Megan Thee Stallion’s cover of Sport Illustrated's 2021 Swimsuit Issue. 🚨 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/mKH2RNgq0K</a></p>— MUSICXCLUSIVES (@MusicXclusives) <a href=#>July 19, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=696 data-injectable=true>In July, she became the first rapper to be featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated, gracing the cover of the swimsuit edition. A week later, she teamed up with Revlon to introduce her own makeup collection, appropriately called Revlon x Megan Thee Stallion Hot Girl Sunset Collection. It’s fairly ingenious, actually, with each set including lip gloss, eyeshadow, false eyelashes, and more.</p><p data-characters=80 data-current-count=80 data-injectable=false>In November, she was named Glamour Magazine’s “Woman of the Year.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false><p lang=da dir=ltr>Megan <a href=#>@TheeStallion</a> stuns for <a href=#>@GlamourMag</a>.</p><p>📸: Kennedi Carter <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/y9XF7xfm1t</a></p>— Pop Crave (@PopCrave) <a href=#>November 2, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true>To top it all off, in December, she teamed up with CashApp to sell her HOT Girl Enterprise clothing collection to benefit numerous charities focused on “education, housing, and health & wellness.”</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>Now, as the world impatiently waits for her new single, it’s safe to say that Megan Pete (you didn’t think her last name was “Thee Stallion,” did you?) has greatly increased her net worth over the last couple years. Not just for her many hit singles and EPs, but also for her business ventures.</p><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true>A year ago, Megan’s net worth was estimated at $3.5 million by Forbes magazine. That has more than doubled in the last several months, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, who estimates her present net worth to be $8 million dollars. This is certainly a testament to Megan’s many achievements and business partnerships in the past year.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>In case you’re wondering, like we were, if this makes her the richest stallion of all time, the answer is not yet. Thoroughbred racehorse Arrogate, an actual stallion, is the richest stallion ever, earning over $17 million dollars from 2016-2018 without having a single hit on the Billboard charts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZ2atKK6jK2fnp1dqMGiuMuipqerXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
