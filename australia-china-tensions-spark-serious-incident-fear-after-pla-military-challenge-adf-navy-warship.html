The warning comes after the Australian Navy frigate HMAS Parramatta was stalked by Chinese aircraft, nuclear submarines and warships.
And on Wednesday, a US warship deliberately sailed within 12 miles of Chinese-claimed territory in the South China Sea in a direct challenge to Beijing.
It follows earlier clashes where Australian military aircraft were threatened by Chinese fighter jets using potentially dangerous flares and chaff, and another targeted by high-power military-grade Chinese lasers."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

resources that the US military can call on.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It’s becoming increasingly difficult – Australia is to a degree isolated,’ Prof Rothwell of Australian National University told the ABC.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It is clear there is a pattern associated with Australia’s activities now [that is] very much aligned with the way in which the United States conducts similar activities.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It needs to be accepted that Australia is often sailing through those waters on their own without a lot of back-up, in the way that the US Navy would often have.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The fears were echoed by former defence personnel minister Darren Chester.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘What concerns me is there’s more likely to be some incident at a future point resulting from a level of misadventure or miscalculation or mistake being made than an actual act of aggression,’ the Nationals MP said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘We need to be very careful and need to make sure we are working closely with our allies. I think it is really important that we try and de-escalate these situations wherever possible.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘At the same time, we have every right to be there. The Australian navy is incredibly professional, incredibly well-trained and incredibly capable and they are just doing their job.’</p><img decoding=async id=i-863a9e22bc1e2b3d src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/13/23/60205349-11011567-image-a-2_1657752600696.jpg height=416 width=634 alt="In May, a Chinese jet fighter released aluminium foil chaff dangerously close to an RAAF Poseidon surveillance plane's jet engines, prompting a diplomatic incident" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><p class=imageCaption>In May, a Chinese jet fighter released aluminium foil chaff dangerously close to an RAAF Poseidon surveillance plane’s jet engines, prompting a diplomatic incident</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In May, a Chinese jet fighter released aluminium foil chaff dangerously close to an RAAF Poseidon surveillance plane’s jet engines, prompting a diplomatic incident.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And another Australian Poseidon surveillance aircraft was targeted by high-powered military lasers from a Chinese ship off the north coast of Australia in February.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>During the federal election campaign, the ADF was also tracking a Chinese naval ship off the west coast of Australia, apparently monitoring military signal traffic.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On Sunday, four&nbsp;USAF B-2A stealth bombers landed in Queensland&nbsp;in a high-profile show of strength and support for Australia.</p><img decoding=async id=i-61a10a3ceda8ca05 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/13/23/60242193-11011567-image-m-10_1657753154345.jpg height=483 width=634 alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><p class=imageCaption>On Sunday, four USAF B-2A stealth bombers landed in Queensland in a high-profile show of strength and support for Australia</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The ‘flying wing’-style aircraft flew 14,000km from their US base in Missouri&nbsp;on a ‘training and strategic deterrence mission&nbsp;in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Squadron commander Lieutenant Colonel Kousgaard added: ‘This deployment of the B-2 to Australia demonstrates and enhances the readiness and lethality of our long-range penetrating strike force.’&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnkarAtb7ApaCaZZOdtq%2BtjK2cp6uZpLu0edKpmKujXaiys7XOrqpmoZ6YtqWxza1kn52Rp3qistOeqWaonJZ6rrXLoquaqqlisKmty6Wcp5%2BVYq6lsoynmK%2BxXayus7%2FHoqdo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
