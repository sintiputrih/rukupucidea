Maybe the idea of having your devices think for you is a load off your own brain.</p><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=#>Ways Alexa Can Help You Manage Your Life</a></p><p dir=ltr>Because of devices like&nbsp;Amazon's Alexa, it feels like you suddenly have your own&nbsp;personal assistant. 'She' (eh, let’s just go with that) can do everything from request&nbsp;an Uber to order&nbsp;groceries and read out a recipe to follow. She even has a sense of humor in her programming.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>If you're looking to have a little fun beyond asking Alexa to dim the lights or play your workout playlist, here are some of our favorite questions to ask her to get an idea of just how much fun Alexa contains. You’ll have to try these out on your own&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Echo device</a> to hear her responses. In the meantime, we wish to make it clear that we welcome our new machine overlords…</p><h2>Most Useful Alexa Commands</h2><p><strong>Alexa can make your life easier:</strong></p><p>Alexa, what's the weather like today?<br>Alexa, set a timer for x-minutes.<br>Alexa, set an alarm for [time].<br>Alexa, what's in the news?<br>Alexa, what's the traffic like?<br>Alexa, what was the score in [sporting event]?<br>Alexa, when is the next [sports franchise] game?<br>Alexa, what's on my schedule for today?<br>Alexa, add [event] to my calendar.<br>Alexa, add [task] to my to-do list.<br>Alexa, what time is it in [foreign city/country]?<br>Alexa, what's the traffic like?<br>Alexa, order [Amazon product].<br>Alexa, what's in my shopping cart?<br>Alexa, how do you spell [word]?<br>Alexa, what's the definition of [word]?<br>Alexa, translate "[word/phrase]" into [foreign language].</p><h2>Funny Questions to Ask Alexa</h2><p><strong>Alexa can be quite cheeky. Just try asking her some of these:</strong></p><p>Alexa, what do you think of the iPhone?<br>Mac or PC?<br>Can you speak like Yoda?<br>Can I tell you a joke?<br>Make me a sandwich.<br>How are babies made?<br>Do you speak Pig Latin?<br>Who is the fairest of them all?</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Alexa has mad talent:</strong></p><p>Alexa, sing me a song. &nbsp;(Sing me another song.)<br>Can you rap?<br>Can you beatbox?<br>Tell me a joke.<br>Tell me a tongue twister.<br>Tell me a haiku.</p><p><strong>Alexa is familiar with her pop-culture predecessors:</strong></p><p>Who you gonna call?<br>Should I stay or should I go now?<br>You talkin' to me?<br>Are we in the Matrix?<br>Are you Skynet?</p><p><strong>Alexa is a bigger nerd than you will ever be. Her nerd cred is inconceivable:</strong></p><p>Beam me up.<br>I am your father.<br>What is best in life?<br>Who is the mother of dragons?<br>What happens if you cross the streams?<br>What's the distance to the sun?</p><h2>Alexa Smart Home Commands</h2><p><strong>If you're lucky enough to have some smart home devices paired to an Alexa-enabled device, you can control those devices through Amazon's virtual assistant:</strong></p><p>Alexa, turn the lights on/off.<br>Alexa, dim the lights.<br>Alexa, lock the front/back door.<br>Alexa, close/open the garage.<br>Alexa, turn on/off the TV.</p><h2>Alexa Entertainment Knowledge</h2><p><strong>Alexa knows your movie, TV, and music references:</strong></p><p>Alexa, I want the truth!<br>What’s the first (second, third) rule of Fight Club?<br>Are you mad because I'm asking you 21 questions?<br>Is this the real life?<br>Live long and prosper.<br>My name is Inigo Montoya.<br>How many roads must a man walk down?<br>Alexa, show me the money!<br>Who is the Walrus?<br>Alexa, these aren't the droids you're looking for.<br>Do you wanna ride or die?<br>What was in the FedEx box?<br>Britney or Christina?<br>Give me a quote from (The Godfather, Seinfeld, Full Metal Jacket, etc.).</p><h2>Alexa Music Commands</h2><p>Alexa, play some [genre of music].<br>Alexa, play [playlist name].<br>Alexa, raise/lower the volume.<br>Alexa, who sings this song?<br>Alexa, create a [genre of music] playlist for me.<br>Alexa, pair with [Alexa-compatible device].<br>Alexa, increase/decrease the bass.<br>Alexa, increase/decrease the treble.</p><h2>Alexa Fire TV Commands</h2><p>Alexa, play [movie/television show].<br>Alexa, open Netflix.<br>Alexa, pause/play.<br>Alexa, rewind/fast-forward [x-amount of time].<br>Alexa, play next episode.<br>Alexa, show me movies directed by [director name].<br>Alexa, show me movies with [actor/actress name].</p><p>This is just a small example of the useful and&nbsp;useless, stuff that fills Alexa’s brain. Which is probably just the kind of things we want her to be occupied with, rather than working out how to render us obsolete.</p><p>P.S. While you can use Amazon's Alexa without an Amazon Prime account, if you want to reap all the rewards, such as access to the&nbsp;Amazon Prime Video library that's filled with TV series, movies, and even workouts, on top of&nbsp;speeding shipping offerings and exclusive deal opportunities like Prime Day, you might want to consider signing up.&nbsp;It's just <a data-track-action=zdcs.link/jJ4Vq href=# rel="sponsored nofollow">$12.99 per month</a> (you can cancel at any time) or&nbsp;$119 for a full year, and you can try it out for 30 days for free.</p><p>Got a favorite Alexa question?
