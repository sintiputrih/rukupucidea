was born Alison Brie Schermerhorn on December 29, 1982.</span></li><li><span>In high school, she performed as a clown for children’s birthday parties.&nbsp;The company she worked for was based in Compton, and her clown name was Sunny;&nbsp;so yeah, she was literally a clown, a few years before she went to CalArts, and there are the kiddie parties to prove it.</span></li><li><span>Her love for the craft didn’t start naïvely recently;&nbsp;when she was growing up, she put on shows for her family, including a fake commercial for “smoked sausages”, for which she wore only a coat and a hot dog between her legs.</span></li><li><span>The first character she played was Toto in the production of her film&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Wizard of Oz</span></strong><span>, while her first television appearance was on an episode of&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Hannah Montana</span></strong><span>&nbsp;in 2006.</span></li><li><span>Actually, here’s an interesting question: Brie listens to “hardcore rap” to pass herself off for auditions.</span></li></ul><ul><li><span>Acting is not her only talent, she also sings very well… So much so that she is part of a cover band with the other two actresses, Cyrina Fiallo and Julianna Guill.&nbsp;The group,&nbsp;</span><strong><span>The Girls</span></strong><span>, perform folk versions of their favorite songs.</span></li><li><span>She has a silly side… one of her hobbies is to mimic memes and believe us when we say she can mimic almost any meme.</span></li><li><span>Talking about multitasking in its heyday, Alison sometimes had to film episodes of both&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Mad Men</span></strong><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Community</span></strong><span>&nbsp;in a Day.</span></li><li><span>The star revealed in an interview with the&nbsp;</span><strong><span>LA Times</span></strong><span>&nbsp;that the role she most wants to play is that of a mental person… So we can’t wait to see her tap into her dark, deep side one of these days. .</span></li></ul><p><span>Let’s not get carried away by the star’s astonishment, it’s time to examine the subject starting with Alison Brie.</span></p><p><span>See also: Height of Shakira Body weight and measurements</span></p><h2><span>Alison Brie’s Height</span></h2><p><span>Calling her a pretty little lady is quite accurate in every sense of the word, as the star is not only pretty but as petite as she comes.&nbsp;She’s 5ft 3in and a testament to how tall isn’t everything, after all the little girls having fun.</span></p><p><span>She has very tall and equally short actors in some of her series, so it might be difficult to gauge her height from time to time.&nbsp;For example, on&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Community</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Joel Mchale outclasses her at 6ft 4in, but she’s right at home with the girls despite Gillian Jacobs being only 5ft 4in and Yvette Nicole Brown was 5ft 2in.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, here is a list of notablecelebrities as great as her.&nbsp;Scarlett Johansson, Kim Kardashian, Natalie Portman, Vanessa Paradis and Mila Kunis share Alison Brie’s highlights.</span></p><p><span>See also: Katy Perry Height, Weight Net Worth</span></p><h2><span>Alison Brie’s Weight</span></h2><p><span>It would be a taboo for her to weigh too much Given her small stature, we think that’s why the star is taking the time to keep her 50 pounds off.&nbsp;So how exactly does she do it?&nbsp;While she most likely has an entire routine going for her, a few go to things that really get her going.</span></p><p><span>The actress calls yoga “her church” and says running never feels like strenuous exercise because it clears her head.&nbsp;Sounds simple and doable, doesn’t it?&nbsp;Well, the best advice we can give you is to tell you to try it at home.</span></p><p><span>See also: Jennifer Lopez Feet, Shoe Size and Shoe Collection</span></p><h2><span>Alison Brie body measurements</span></h2><p><span>Along with
