This results in a total of 59 bodies floating down the lower Hudson every year (49 or 50 from NYC, 5 or 6 from Bergen County, and about 4 from Hudson County).</p><p>Regarding this, What kind of fish live in Hudson Bay? Cod, halibut, salmon and polar plaice are the most common fish. Walrus, dolphins and killer whales live in the northern regions and polar bears migrate south to hunt seals among the ice. Some 200 species of birds including ducks, snow geese, gulls, swans, sandpipers, owls and crows gather on the coasts and islands.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Hudson_Bay_freeze_over></span><strong>Does Hudson Bay freeze over?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Generally, Hudson Bay starts freezing up by early November, and the northern part of the basin is typically entirely iced over by the end of the month.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_the_Hudson_Bay_fresh_or_salt_water></span><strong>Is the Hudson Bay fresh or salt water?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While it is a saltwater or brackish body, Hud- son Bay receives freshwater inflow at an annual volume of some 170 cubic miles (700 cubic kilo- meters); even more comes from precipitation and ice melt. Consequently, and also due to its limited hydraulic exchange with the Atlantic, the bay is less salty than the ocean.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_state_does_not_have_a_river></span><strong>What state does not have a river?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>However, there are many partial state boundaries, particularly in the Midwest, Northeast, and South, that are defined by rivers; in fact, only five states (Colorado, Hawaii, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming) completely lack any borders defined by rivers or waterways.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_the_fastest_flowing_river_in_the_United_States></span><strong>What is the fastest flowing river in the United States?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>This is a list of rivers in the continental United States by average discharge (streamflow) in cubic feet per second.</p><p>List of U.S. rivers by discharge.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>No</th><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>River</th><td>Mississippi River</td></tr><tr><th>Length (km)</th><td>3,730</td></tr><tr><th>Length (miles)</th><td>2,320</td></tr><tr><th>Average discharge (cfs)</th><td>593,000</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_the_shallowest_river_in_the_United_States></span><strong>What is the shallowest river in the United States?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Platte River</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Platte River Nebraska River, Shallow River, Ñíbraxge (iow), Pȟaŋkéska Wakpá (lkt), Ní Btháska (oma), Kíckatus (paw)</th></tr><tr><td>• coordinates</td><td>40°38′23″N 106°24′19″W</td></tr><tr><td>• length</td><td>716 mi (1,152 km)</td></tr><tr><td>• elevation</td><td>8,050 ft (2,450 m)</td></tr><tr><td>2nd source</td><td>South Platte River</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_there_sharks_in_the_Hudson_River></span><strong>Are there sharks in the Hudson River?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It’s known to frequent rivers, shallow waters and other bodies of fresh water. Because of its aggressive behavior, many say a bull shark is the most dangerous shark. In 2015, amateur fisherman Wu Zhen caught a shark in the Hudson River near Battery Park in New York City, the New York Post reports.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_many_bodies_are_on_Mt_Everest></span><strong>How many bodies are on Mt Everest?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While some bodies have been removed, it is estimated that over 100 remain on the mountain.

Adventurous fishers find that the remote area in northeastern Canada provides excellent fishing possibilities as long as the trip is carefully planned.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_there_salmon_in_Hudson_Bay></span><strong>Is there salmon in Hudson Bay?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Atlantic salmon have been occasionally reported along eastern Hudson Bay, north of Richmond Gulf; however, in the Nastapoka River estuary they dominated gill-net catches over a 3-year period. The results of surveys of native fishermen suggest that this is the only anadromous stock in eastern Hudson Bay.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_the_is_not_used_before_Hudson_Bay></span><strong>Why the is not used before Hudson Bay?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No article is necessary before the following specific nouns: Singular names of countries or territories, cities, towns, states, streets, lakes, bays, mountains, continents, islands, languages, sports, academic subjects.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Hudson_Bay_an_ocean></span><strong>Is Hudson Bay an ocean?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Hudson Bay is often considered part of the Arctic Ocean: the International Hydrographic Organization, in its 2002 working draft of Limits of Oceans and Seas, defined Hudson Bay, with its outlet extending from 62.5 to 66.5 degrees north (just a few miles south of the Arctic Circle) as being part of the Arctic Ocean,</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_there_polar_bears_in_Hudson_Bay></span><strong>Are there polar bears in Hudson Bay?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As Canada’s polar bears migrate from the inland to the shores of Hudson Bay, many of them converge in Churchill. It is estimated that 1,200 or more of these creatures move through the area each autumn. The window period to see these bears is very brief, lasting from October to early November.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_there_sharks_in_Hudson_Bay></span><strong>Are there sharks in Hudson Bay?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Previous distributional records exist for Greenland Shark in some locations in eastern Hudson Bay, however, one individual was captured at Coral Harbour in 2018 in northwestern Hudson Bay and is the closest record to Manitoba waters for any shark species.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_is_the_Hudson_Bay_important></span><strong>Why is the Hudson Bay important?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC), famous for their iconic Point Blankets and their role in starting the fur trade industry in Canada, is named after this large body of water.
