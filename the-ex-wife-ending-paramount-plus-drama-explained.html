He realises that the only way to have biological children, which he desperately wants, is to start a family with someone other than Jen, hatching a plan to woo Tasha, and then marry her after she falls pregnant. His plan was to leave her and resume life with Jen, with Tasha’s child, lying to both Tasha and Jen about each other so that <strong>Jen thinks Tasha is a manipulative liar, and Tasha believes Jen is getting involved in their marriage.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=esdsKDXDB80U data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>13 Netflix horror films and TV shows that will keep you awake at night this Halloween 2022</a></strong></p><p id=erqPnMA5_KQ7 data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Virgin River's Alexandra Breckenridge shares cheeky behind-the-scenes bedroom clip with Martin Henderson</a></strong></p><p id=e-PYxXpTPrg2 data-wc=79>However, in the final episode, Jen realises that it has actually been Jack who has been lying to her, and despite desperately wanting a child, she tells Tasha where she can find Emily before it is too late - telling her to meet them at Heathrow.
