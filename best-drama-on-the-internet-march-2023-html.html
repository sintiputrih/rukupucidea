Several things happen in the TikTokshort film: First, Romy says she had to Google the difference between garlic and onion.

Williams created the “No Love” challenge back in November 2022, going viral across the app to the point of losing cultural context as non-Black creators co-opted the choreography.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clg2l7y4t003v3b6v24jn61no@published data-word-count=81>As Greene explains to the class (his 599K followers), majorette dancing came to the U.S in the 1960s and became a staple of historically Black colleges and universities. The distinct choreography typically accompanies marching bands during sports halftime shows and features bold costumes and baton-twirling. He points out that some people erroneously attribute the choreography to K-pop while white creators are participating without an awareness of its cultural significance — and judging by most of the videos, a sense of rhythm.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clg2l7y4t003w3b6v2w42vtkt@published data-word-count=50><strong>Why it’s a 3: </strong>While the app has evolved into much more than a dance platform, the issues of cultural ownership and the mistreatment of Black creators remain front and center.

If that doesn’t scream <a title=fastfashionmeangirl href=#>#fastfashionmeangirl</a> I don’t know what to tell you. This doesnt even begin to scratch the surface regarding LTK (and other affiliate networks like it) that act as digital MLMs unbeknownst to most influencers using it. For context, I used to work for a software company that sold the technology affiliate networks are built on. Most LTK (or Amazon) affiliates don’t have any real shot of moving into a place where you are making any type of living unless you were an early adopter or have connections. Mainly because there are mechanisms within the software and the sales cycle itself that will attribute sales to the same influencers over and over again vs. the original influencers that introduced the product or prompted their audience to download the LTK app (let me know if you want more videos on this). Meaning that the masses are doing the actual work and the top .05%-1% are profiting by the millions. See below video titled: ‘The Customer Influencer Archetype’. While continuing to promote their success as an individual accomplishment. It’s fascinating and I promise you that I don’t wish for any person’s or businesses demise. I am here to educate, share my knowledge and facilitate ethical business models within the creator community. We consistently turn a blind eye to bad behavior by saying ‘business is just business’, but unfortunately those actions don’t occur in a vacuum and they effect many, many other people. And in this case, Dani Austin™️ is purposefully stealing the term ‘de-influenced’ to shift attention away from it’s intended use and silence the slow fashion movement. You really can’t make this stuff up. 🤷🏼‍♀️ <a title=deinfluencingbeauty href=#>#deinfluencingbeauty</a> <a title=deinfluencinginfluencing href=#>#deinfluencinginfluencing</a> <a title=deinfluenced href=#>#deinfluenced</a> <a title=slowfashiontiktok href=#>#slowfashiontiktok</a> Origin of De-Influencing —> @the_rogue_essentials The Customer/Influencer Archetype —> @the_rogue_essentials</p><a title="♬ original sound - The Rogue Essentials" href=#>♬ original sound - The Rogue Essentials</a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clg2kvv7e00363b6vf0tqst3n@published data-word-count=58>An influencer starting a podcast about de-influencing has very “<a href=#>we’re all trying to find the guy who did this</a>” energy.
