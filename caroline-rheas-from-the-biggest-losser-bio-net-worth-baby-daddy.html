Growing up, Caroline shared everything with her sisters Celia and Cynthia. She went to an all-girls private school – The Study – in her hometown, then Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, and later the University of Arizona.</p><h2><span id=Move_to_New_York_and_Career_Start>Move to New York and Career Start</span></h2><p>After finishing her studies, Rhea moved to New York, feeling she had more opportunities there to launch her career. She started by performing in nightclubs such as Catch a Rising Star, then The Comic Strip among others, where she shared the scene with Chris Rock, Dave Attell, Louis C.K. and Marc Maron among others. However, it wasn’t that easy at the start, so Caroline also worked as a waitress for seven years before her big break.
