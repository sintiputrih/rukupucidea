However, the repetition itself is likely the point of the song, as in many contemporary hip-hop and R&B tracks, the chorus often repeats a catchy phrase or melody in order to engrain it in the listener's mind. In this case, "My bae" is the phrase that is meant to stick with the listener, providing a simple yet catchy chorus that could potentially become an earworm for those who hear the song.</p><br><p>Beyond this, there is little else to glean from the lyrics of "My Bae." There are no verses or bridges, and the song has no clear narrative structure or thematic message. It is possible that the song is intended simply as a dance track, with the repeated phrase serving as a refrain to pump up the energy of a crowd. Overall, there is little substance to the lyrics themselves, so any interpretation would have to focus on the form in which the lyrics are presented rather than the content.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>My bae my bae my bae my bae</u><br>My significant other, to whom I am deeply and affectionately attached, and who holds a special place in my heart and life</p><br><p><u>My bae my bae my bae my bae</u><br>The person who brings me joy, happiness, and fulfillment in my life, and whom I cherish deeply</p><br><p><u>My bae my bae my bae my bae</u><br>The one who understands me, supports me, and loves me unconditionally, despite my flaws and imperfections</p><br><p><u>My bae my bae my bae my bae</u><br>The one who I want to spend my life with, and who I envision building a future with</p><br><p><u>My bae my bae my bae my bae</u><br>The one who I think about all the time, and who I can't imagine my life without</p><br><p><u>My bae my bae my bae my bae</u><br>The person who completes me, and who makes me a better version of myself</p><br><p><u>My bae my bae my bae my bae</u><br>The one who brings a smile to my face, and who makes me laugh and feel happy</p><br><p><u>My bae my bae my bae my bae</u><br>The person who I trust completely, and who I know will always be there for me</p><br><p><u>My bae my bae my bae my bae</u><br>The one who I have a deep and meaningful connection with, and who I am blessed to have in my life</p><br><p><u>My bae my bae my bae my bae</u><br>The person who I love more than anything or anyone else in this world, and who I will always cherish and adore</p><br><p><u>My bae my bae my bae my bae</u><br>The one who I am proud to call my partner, and who I will always stand by and support</p><br><p><u>My bae my bae my bae my bae</u><br>The person who makes my heart skip a beat, and who I will always hold close to my heart</p><br><p><u>My bae my bae my bae my bae</u><br>The one who I am grateful for, and who I thank the heavens for bringing into my life</p><br><p><u>My bae my bae my bae my bae</u><br>The person who I am blessed to have found, and who I will always love, cherish, and hold dear</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Writer(s): Daniel Mcloyd</span></p><p>Contributed by Sadie M.
