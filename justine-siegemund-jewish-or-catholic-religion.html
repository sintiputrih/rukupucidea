Religion</h2><p>Justine Siegemund was a renowned midwife and obstetrician, born on December 26, 1636, in Rohnstock, Lower Silesia.&nbsp;</p><p>She was the daughter of Elias Diettrich, a Lutheran minister in Rohnstock, who unfortunately passed away in 1650 when Justine was only 14 years old.</p><p>Her religious affiliation remains unclear despite her many accomplishments, leaving many curious about her background. It has been speculated that she was either Jewish or Catholic; however, no specific evidence supports these beliefs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Justine-Siegemundin-FrauenOrte-Brandenburg.png><p>In 1655, Justine married Christian Siegemund, an accountant, but despite their long-lasting marriage, the couple remained childless.</p><p>Nevertheless, Christian was a supportive partner who encouraged and aided Justine in her professional career.</p><p>However, Siegemund’s inability to have children made it hard for her to work as a midwife because midwives who couldn’t have children weren’t allowed to work.</p><p>This discriminatory law, perpetuated for centuries, was a significant barrier for midwives, particularly those unable to conceive.</p><p>However, Siegemund refused to let this law restrict her from pursuing her passion for obstetrics.</p><p>She had previously experienced the consequences of incompetent midwifery firsthand during her childbearing journey.</p><p>Therefore, she decided to educate herself extensively on obstetrics, which included the study of pregnancy, childbirth, and post-birth care.</p><h2>Justine Siegemund Death Cause&nbsp;</h2><p>Justine Siegemund was a German midwife and author who lived in the 17th century. There is currently no evidence pointing to a particular cause of death for Justine Siegemund.</p><p>However, it is known that she died on November 10, 1705, at 68, in Berlin. She was known for rarely using early pharmaceuticals or surgical instruments in her midwifery work.</p><p>Instead, she relied on her experience and knowledge of natural remedies to help women through childbirth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/preview_ppa467212.jpg><p>Throughout her career, Siegemund helped bring thousands of infants into the world.

She holds the honor of being the first person in Germany to write a book on obstetrics from a woman’s perspective.</p><p>Her passion for obstetrics originated from a personal experience of mistreatment by incompetent midwives who wrongly assumed she was pregnant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/celebrating-justine-siegemund-6753651837109580.2-2x.png><p>At the young age of 20, Siegemund began educating herself about obstetrics and began practicing in 1659.</p><p>Initially, she provided free midwifery services to peasant and poor women in her local area. As her expertise grew, she diversified her client base to include women from merchant and noble families.</p><p>Despite facing criticism and accusations of unsafe birthing practices from her former supervisor in 1680, Siegemund persisted in her work.</p><p>In 1689, she traveled to Frankfurt on the Oder and submitted her draft manual to the medical faculty, which approved her medical documentation.</p><p>Siegemund’s most outstanding achievement was the publication of her authoritative obstetrical textbook, the Court Midwife, in 1690.
