This was just as Subud began spreading across the world from where it originated in Southeast Asia, according to <a href=#>Virginia Living</a>. Subud is based on the teachings of Muḥammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo, a student of Ṣūfism, or Islāmic mysticism. Subuh believed that through wild and primal dancing and other forms of unrestrained movement, as well as loud vocalization, faithful practitioners are brought closer to God, and ultimately, rapture, according to <a href=#>Britannica</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>The Arquettes and early practitioners of Subud in Virginia had utopian goals when they founded their commune. As many as 750 people gathered in the community where David Arquette was born. According to <a href=#>Marie Claire</a>, however, there was no electricity and running water on-site, and eventually, a dark side crept into the project, including drugs, alcohol, and violence. It all fell apart in the 1970s. Luckily, David and Patricia Arquette were able to pick up the pieces as adults.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCCk21wa2xfqbWmedOrrK2gXZavsMHTZpuarpmZeqK6w2anmqyinrCqrYyaqaqtlanBpr%2BMrqWuq6WWuW6vx6KjnaCfpLFw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
