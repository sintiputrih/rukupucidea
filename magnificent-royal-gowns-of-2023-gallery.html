On both occasions, the Princess paired it with the<a href=#> Lover's Knot tiara</a>; made by Garrards in 1914 for Queen Mary and a favourite of the late Princess Diana.</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=d4fe2c544eea-princess-beatrice-gowns>Princess Beatrice's embellished wedding guest gown</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d4fe2c544eea-princess-beatrice-gowns.jpg><p>Princess Beatrice made a surprising appearance at the royal wedding of Crown Prince Hussein of Jordan and Princess Rajwa in June, wearing a breathtaking Champagne-hued satin gown featuring an embellished bodice by Reem Acra.</p><p>Most striking, however, was <a href=#>the royal's choice to wear the York tiara.</a> The occasion marked only the second time in her life she had worn a tiara in public - and was made even more special by the fact it was her mother's wedding tiara.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Princess Beatrice wears York tiara for Jordan royal banquet</figure><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=1924d9c91883-princess-charlene-silver-dress>Princess Charlene of Monaco's sparkling silver gown</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1924d9c91883-princess-charlene-silver-dress.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=5da585866c5e-george-charlotte-holding-hands>Princess Charlotte's ivory gown</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5da585866c5e-george-charlotte-holding-hands.jpg><p dir=ltr>The Prince and Princess of Wales' eight-year-old daughter Charlotte was every inch a Princess as she stepped into the spotlight for her grandfather King Charles' coronation in May.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>The young royal was the double of mum Princess Kate in a silk crepe dress designed by Alexander McQueen, her mother's beloved wedding dress designer, which also marked Princess Charlotte's first time wearing the coveted British designer. She may be years from reaching her full style potential, but Princess Kate's mini me already has a more fashionable wardrobe than most.</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=94d67f3f2854-gettyimages-1467678911>Princess Kate's eco BAFTAs gown</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/94d67f3f2854-gettyimages-1467678911.jpg><p dir=ltr>The Princess of Wales' eco credentials reigned supreme when she recycled her one-shoulder Alexander McQueen gown at the 2023 BAFTAs in February. The royal made a serious sustainable statement by re-wearing the dress, which she previously wore to the event in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Reworking it to remove the blooming floral motif and adding a contemporary cape detail, the Princess proved that repeating outfits is not only acceptable, but in vogue for red carpet events.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>While many considered them divisive, I loved the dramatic ebony opera gloves the royal slipped into to give her recycled gown its revival.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=76da68e64cca-queen-camilla-coronation-dress>Queen Camilla's Coronation gown</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/76da68e64cca-queen-camilla-coronation-dress.jpg><p dir=ltr>One of the most magnificent gowns in royal history, let alone in 2023, is undoubtedly Queen Camilla's bespoke Coronation gown crafted exclusively for the wife of King Charles by one of her most trusted designers, Bruce Oldfield.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>The gown, which took Oldfield "six years to make" featured stunning personalised embellishments, including delicate garlands of abstract wildflowers from fields and hedgerows, and the names of Queen Camilla's grandchildren embroidered along the hem.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Camilla's ivory dress was made from Peau de Soie, a silk fabric with a dull lustre finish, and woven by Stephen Walters in Suffolk, England. With an ivory, silver and gold colour palette, bracelet length sleeves, a strong shoulder and a wide V-neck neckline – it gave the royal an undeniably regal silhouette for the historic ceremony.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm660tMiopWiqn66urXnSrbClnV9qfnF%2BkHBmppmXo7antcKepa1loqTGoriMoKawpqNivKd5kWlpbGWXlrmtsdGyZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
