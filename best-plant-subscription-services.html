Each plant will be in their optimal growing stage to make caring for it simple and easy. All the instructions will be provided, all you have to do is pot it and watch as it flourishes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/mygardenbox.jpg><p>Consider this your sign to turn your home and outdoor space into a live-in greenhouse.
