Ariel has been showing off her slimmed down figure every chance she gets lately, and her workout outfits just keep getting sexier. Ariel stepped out to the gym most recently on Monday, April 15, in LA. Ariel chose to show off her long, lean legs in a pair of super short, navy blue $30 Under Armour UA On The Court 4″ Volleyball Shorts paired with a tight black zip-up sweatshirt which she chose to zip up all the way, and her usual black Nike workout sneakers. She threw her black hair up into a messy bun, leaving wisps out in the front, framing her face. She admitted in a fan Q&A in April 2019, what made her lose so much weight, saying that she was on anti-depressant medications that caused her to retain all of her wait, leaving her unable to lose it, no matter how hard she tried. However, after switch around her medications, she finally found the right one for her, and now her metabolism has come back, causing her to shed all the weight she was previously unable to lose. Some of her other best workout looks include: her neon pink leggings, her sheer mesh tops, and her sexy sports bras with leggings.
