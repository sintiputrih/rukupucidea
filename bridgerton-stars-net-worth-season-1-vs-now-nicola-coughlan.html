Because of their status prior to season one, many hit a major growth in their net worth between the releases of each season. Here is how the Bridgerton stars’ net worths changed from 2020 to 2022.</p><h2 id=simone-ashley-39-s-net-worth-increased-by-over-2-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Simone Ashley's Net Worth Increased By Over $2 Million</span></h2><p>Simone Ashley joined the Bridgerton set for season two, portraying the character “Kate Sharma.” While she was not part of the cast for season one, Simone was best known in 2020 for the Netflix series Sex Education. Her net worth at that time <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was at approximately $200,000</a>, as she had only been cast fourteen times since 2016. The most recent update shows that her net worth is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">now between $2-3 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicola-coughlan-over-doubled-her-700-000-net-worth><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Nicola Coughlan Over Doubled Her $700,000 Net Worth</span></h2><p>While <a href=#>Irish actress Nicola Coughlan plays “Penelope Featherington”</a> in the show, the role that boosted her to stardom was through the TV series Derry Girls. She has been cast in fifteen works thus far, one being a movie that is still filming, and many of those roles have been on television shows. Her net worth for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">season one of Bridgerton was around $700,000</a> but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rose to $2 million</a> after the release of season two.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Bridgerton' Star Nicola Coughlan Reacts To People Commenting On Her Body</a></span></p><h2 id=claudia-jessie-made-a-multi-million-dollar-leap-since-season-2><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Claudia Jessie Made A Multi-Million Dollar Leap Since Season 2</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Claudia Jessie plays young “Eloise Bridgerton,”</a> joining the cast in 2020.
