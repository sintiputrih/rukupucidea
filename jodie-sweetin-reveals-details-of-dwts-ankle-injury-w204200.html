I was in so much pain I thought there was no way that the bone couldn’t be broken,” she says.</p><p><span>Thankfully, after being rushed to hospital, the X-ray technician had good news. “She said, ‘I don’t see anything broken!’ I was like, ‘Oh my god!’ Just the amount of relief I felt when she said that. I was so scared. I didn’t want to be done!”</span></p><span class=caption></span><p><span>“Keo and my fiancé and friends were all texting for constant updates when I was at the hospital,” Sweetin continued. “Everyone was very concerned but I was like, ‘I think I’m going to be OK!'”</span></p><p><span>But while her doctor’s orders included rest, one thing the <i>Fuller House</i> star wasn’t very good at was putting her feet up! “I went back to the studio that day, not to dance on it, but to finish up a couple of things, and the executive producers were like, ‘Why are you here!?'”</span></p><p>Sweetin did eventually relent and go home for the rest of the day. “But I was back the next day!” she added.</p><p>And although she’s desperate to stay in the contest for as long as she can, Sweetin did admit she knew all along that the likelihood of injuring herself at some point was pretty high.</p><p><span>“You push yourself this much, and especially with a dance like we did this week,”—Sweetin and Motsepe performed <b>Pink</b>‘s “Try”— “there’s no way you’re not going to hurt yourself somehow. This is as athletic as playing a sport and if you push yourself to that extreme, you hurt things,” she said.</span></p><p>“After doing this number, I have a huge appreciation for Pink!” she added.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGonJmaerTDxJ6roqZdp7K3scClqmaclamuqrjSZqafZZSswbR5wKeipZ1dnrurwdGyZLBqYGl%2FcXyO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
