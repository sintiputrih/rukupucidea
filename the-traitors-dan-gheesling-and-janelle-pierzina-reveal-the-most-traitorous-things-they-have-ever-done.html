The success of the first installment led to the producers inviting back many legends of reality television.
Within the group of 21 new players are two Big Brother legends competing for the $250,000 prize.
Big Brother winners Cody Calafiore and Rachel Reilly played in the first season but finished short of making it to the end.

The players were asked to name the most traitorous thing they had ever done.</p><p>“I think the most traitorous thing I’ve ever done, all you have to do is look up two seasons of&nbsp;Big Brother. I’m sure you can pick out hundreds of examples, but that’s not my real life,” Dan <a href=#>told Entertainment Weekly</a>.</p><p>“When I play these games, it’s my chance to live my hobby. I really enjoy playing these games and I don’t do it in real life because I’m just a nice guy… or so they think,” Dan added.</p><p>Janelle was more abrupt with her answer to the question.</p><p>“The most traitorous thing that I’ve ever done? I would never admit to that. So maybe I am a true Traitor, but I would never admit that,” Janelle stated.</p><p>Below is a teaser trailer released by Peacock ahead of the new season.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-more-about-the-traitors-2>More about The Traitors 2</h2><p><a href=#>Here is a breakdown of The Traitors 2 cast</a> and the game rules.
