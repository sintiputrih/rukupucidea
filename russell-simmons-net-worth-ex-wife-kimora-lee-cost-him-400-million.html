This was a result of Simmons founding Def Jam Records and bringing rap to mainstream America. He took artists that were otherwise being overlooked by the <strong><a href=#>music</a> </strong>industry and gave them their own space. Simmons gave them a voice. <a href=#>Simmons gave hip-hop artists the ability to become some of the highest-selling in the industry</a>. As a result, Simmons also built himself a massive fortune.</p><p>Being one of hip-hop's first entrepreneurs, Simmons was not content with only being the founder of Def Jam alone. Instead, he wanted to expand his empire. In doing so, Simmons took the comedy scene and fashion industry by storm. This further built Simmons' fortune, but it also introduced Simmons to his now ex-wife, Kimora Lee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/after-his-kids-labeled-him-abusive-russell-simmons-was-slammed-with-a-lawsuit-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>After His Kids Labeled Him Abusive, Russell Simmons Was Slammed With A Lawsuit</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Russell Simmons has a lot on his plate to answer for being labeled verbally abusive to his kids and being accused of sexual abuse and defamation.</span><p>The then-couple were married in 1998. <a href=#>Lee welcomed the first two of her five children</a> with Simmons. But Ming Lee Simmons and Aoki Lee Simmons were not enough to keep Lee and Simmons from divorcing in 2009, in a divorce that was expensive for Simmons. It turns out that after the divorce, Simmons' net worth dropped substantially.</p><h2 id=russell-simmons-39-current-net-worth-is-10-million>Russell Simmons' Current Net Worth Is $10 Million</h2><h3 id=russell-simmons-has-lost-a-fortune-over-the-years>Russell Simmons has lost a fortune over the years</h3><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Simmons is currently worth $10 million</a>.

While the fortune was being built with the launching of the careers of The Beastie Boys, LL Cool J, Public Enemy, Run DMC, and more, it was when Simmons sold his share of Def Jam in 1999 for $100 million that he became insanely wealthy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/instar51114027-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Simmons did not just sit on his laurels after selling Def Jam, however.

But from the start, the relationship was troubled, all because Simmons was unable to remain faithful.</p><p>Before Lee and Simmons got together, Lee's friends were warning her to stay away from Simmons because of his reputation for being a "bad boy." But Lee fell hard and quickly for Simmons.</p><p>Despite the fact that he was not initially able to settle down, Lee stuck the relationship out.
