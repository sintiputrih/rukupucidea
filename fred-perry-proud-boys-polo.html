It mentioned that the iconic design has been around since the '70s and that it is now working to lawyers "to pursue any unlawful use of our brand."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Despite its lineage, we have seen that the Black/Yellow/Yellow twin tipped shirt is taking on a new and very different meaning in North America as a result of its association with the Proud Boys," the statement read. "That association is something we must do our best to end. We therefore made the decision to stop selling the Black/Yellow/Yellow twin tipped shirt in the US from September 2019, and we will not sell it there or in Canada again until we’re satisfied that its association with the Proud Boys has ended."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Proud Boys was established in 2016 during the presidential election by VICE Media co-founder Gavin McInnes. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Southern Poverty Law Center</a> has since designated the Proud Boys a hate group, citing a known love of "white nationalist memes" as well as "anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric" — something the Proud Boys deny, claiming they are actually “anti-political correctness” and “anti-white guilt."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In case you missed it, President Trump was asked during 2020's first Presidential Debate if he would denounce the group and tell them to stand down. He instead said to "stand back and stand by."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ykuM6tn6Kml2Szs7HDZqeeqqKuerG%2Bzq6bZpqfrsBuvM6lpg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
