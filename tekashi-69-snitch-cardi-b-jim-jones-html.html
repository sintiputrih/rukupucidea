According to federal prosecutors, <a href=#>Ellision kidnapped Hernandez at gunpoint in July 2018</a>. The Feds allege that Mack peddled heroin and ecstasy.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0r8bq5v003m2a6kphsl7pdx@published data-word-count=19>As the prosecution wrapped up its questioning of Hernandez, assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Longyear asked him about Jim Jones.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0r8bo0d00372a6k6rfycfen@published data-word-count=15>“He’s a retired rapper,” Hernandez said.

(She has<a href=#> discussed Bloods affiliation before</a>, but talking about other people’s gang ties is poor form, which is probably one of the reasons there’s a #Tekashisnitch9 hashtag.) A rep for Cardi has since denied Hernandez’s allegation, <a href=#>telling TMZ</a>, “This is not true.” Later, TMZ reported that <a href=#>Cardi admitted Bloods ties</a> but made clear she had nothing to do with Nine Trey.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0rcg733000w2a6k0zrzygoy@published data-word-count=15>There was also a brief repartee in which Longyear asked Hernandez to explain “dry snitching.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0rcg92300112a6ksqop5kyz@published data-word-count=22>“Dry snitching is like … snitching without snitching,” Hernandez said.&nbsp;“You’re telling people what happened …[but] you’re not putting your name on it.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0rci6gt001s2a6k23exwgwo@published data-word-count=66>He also discussed his beef with rapper Chief Keef, which culminated in a shooting outside a Times Square hotel in June 2018. Hernandez said he asked his friend Kooda to shoot at Keef,&nbsp;agreeing to pay him $20,000 in return. Hernandez met up with Kooda after the June 2, 2018 shooting; he testified that he only wound up giving him $10,000 because Kooda fired into the air.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0r8bnz4002s2a6k8x5yu412@published data-word-count=13>The courtroom drama was intensified by several embarrassing security breaches at the courthouse.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0r8bo0300322a6ktuzj2hy3@published data-word-count=66>Recording audio and video in federal courthouses is strictly prohibited.&nbsp;People aren’t allowed to take electronics into the courthouse unless they have special permission. Somehow, however, illegally recorded audio and video of Hernandez’s testimony leaked. Audio was posted to YouTube on Wednesday.&nbsp;A still photo and video of Hernandez’s testimony was posted to DJ Akademiks’s Twitter account Thursday.

He also claimed that the total value of jewelry stolen during his alleged kidnapping was some $365,000.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0r8bnzx002z2a6kalvia23q@published data-word-count=20>Ellison’s lawyer, Devereaux Cannick, continued to portray Hernandez as a fabulist who staged his kidnapping to promote the “FEFE” video.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0r8bnz5002t2a6kon1p2ffd@published data-word-count=6>“You were kidnapped on the 21st?”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0r8bo0a00342a6knntpnqie@published data-word-count=5>“No,” Hernandez said. “July 22.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0r8bnze002u2a6kiiadmhcl@published data-word-count=8>“And when was ‘FEFE’ supposed to be released?”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0r8bo6v00392a6kxgo8xm2w@published data-word-count=2>“July 22.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0r8boz5003c2a6kivay8w7k@published data-word-count=17>“So this alleged robbery and kidnapping happened hours before ‘FEFE’ was supposed to be released?” Cannick said.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0r8bq5r003k2a6k4gc91muv@published data-word-count=1>“Correct.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0r8bprp003i2a6kle1rw7k9@published data-word-count=37>As part of this strategy, Cannick also asked Hernandez about trolling&nbsp;— which Hernandez had said “can mean a lot of things but, to me, it means agonizing, mocking … showin’ off a little bit of my personality.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0r8bo0200312a6ka45ddf3e@published data-word-count=11>“Did you tell others to suck your body parts?” Cannick asked.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0r8bold003b2a6kfj06wume@published data-word-count=1>“Correct.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0r8bog0003a2a6kmky3asul@published data-word-count=6>“Who did you tell that to?”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0r8boz7003d2a6k534m4tnm@published data-word-count=3>“Everyone,” Hernandez said.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0r8bpdc003f2a6kbwjkacl1@published data-word-count=33>The Brooklyn-born rapper also talked about his plea deal: He copped to nine federal counts in January and agreed to cooperate against Nine Trey in the hopes of landing a more lenient sentence.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0r8bprl003h2a6kgtvlmjew@published data-word-count=60>Under normal circumstances, Hernandez would face a minimum of 47 years in federal lockup.&nbsp;If Hernandez meets the terms of his plea deal — “to tell the truth, to testify,” he explained — prosecutors can write a “5K1” letter, which would let the judge sentence him below the minimum.&nbsp;(To be clear, the sentence would still be totally up to the judge.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0r8bprp003j2a6kpqrezeej@published data-word-count=10>“What type of information goes in the letter?” Longyear asked.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0r8bprk003g2a6kzfpbw36l@published data-word-count=8>“The good, bad, and the ugly,” Hernandez said.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0rch2i4001c2a6kyhm2jpei@published data-word-count=18>Hernandez’s next court appearance will likely be his sentencing, which is expected to take place in January 2020.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck0r9o92w000r3h6hvb55zj2n@published data-word-count=43><strong>Update, 6:28 p.m.: </strong>Cardi B has responded to Tekashi 6ix9ine’s testimony that she is involved with the East Coast gang Nine Trey.
